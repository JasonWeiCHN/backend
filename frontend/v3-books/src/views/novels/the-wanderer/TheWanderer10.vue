  <p>
    I looked searchingly at the two men and noted that the Frenchman guiltily
    thrust a wine jar behind the clock with his foot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both men averted their eyes in some embarrassment, and then Master Francois
    said boastfully, “All clocks have their little ways, or we clockmakers would
    be out of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know this one inside out and to take apart so complicated a mechanism
    would be laborious and risky.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we have been content to refresh our memories and compare our pre-eminent
    knowledge, and so perhaps discover what the fault may be.
  </p>
  <p>It is not worth dismantling so costly a toy without good reason.</p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier is—forgive my candor—somewhat eccentric to regard this
    little irregularity as a bad omen.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” In his drunkenness he continued to speak so slightingly of the Grand
    Vizier that I grew angry and raised my hand to strike him— though I doubt
    whether I would have done so as he held a hammer in his hand and had the
    look of a testy man.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the German flung himself between us and said, “If the clock is sick, the
    noble Grand Vizier is more so.
  </p>
  <p>
    No man in his senses keeps his eyes constantly on a clock and loses sleep
    because of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    At night he often gets up to look at it and in the daytime he will break off
    in the middle of a sentence before the assembled Divan and stand staring at
    the dial.
  </p>
  <p>Each time he holds his head in his hand and says, ‘My clock is losing.</p>
  <p>Allah be gracious to me, my clock runs slow.</p>
  <p>’ Is that the talk of a sensible man?</p>
  <p>
    ” I left the fellow and hurried to the brightly lit chamber where the Grand
    Vizier was sitting cross legged on a triple cushion with a reading stand
    before him.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not sure whether he was really reading or pretending to do so; at any
    rate, he turned a page calmly before raising his eyes to mine.
  </p>
  <p>
    I prostrated myself to kiss the ground g y p y g before him, stammering for
    joy and calling down blessings upon him on his happy return from the war.
  </p>
  <p>
    He silenced me with a gesture of his thin hand and looked me straight in the
    eyes, while a shadow of ineffable sorrow stole over his face.
  </p>
  <p>
    His skin had lost its youthful glow and the roses of his cheeks were faded.
  </p>
  <p>
    His soft black beard made his face seem ghostly pale in the lamplight, and
    as he had removed his turban no diamonds sparkled over his brow.
  </p>
  <p>
    He had grown so thin that the rings hung loose upon his fingers and seemed
    too heavy for them.
  </p>
  <p>“What do you want, Michael el-Hakim?</p>
  <p>” he asked.</p>
  <p>“I am Ibrahim, lord of the nations and steward of the Sultan’s power.</p>
  <p>I can make you vizier if it pleases me.</p>
  <p>I can transform beggars into defterdars and boatmen to admirals.</p>
  <p>But though I hold the Sultan’s own seal I cannot help myself.</p>
  <p>
    ” He showed me the Sultan’s square seal hanging on a gold chain about his
    neck under the flowered kaftan.
  </p>
  <p>
    I uttered a cry of amazement and pressed my face to the ground once more in
    veneration for this most precious object that no one but the Sultan might
    use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier hid it beneath his kaftan once more and said in a tone of
    indifference, “With your own eyes you have seen the boundless trust reposed
    in me.
  </p>
  <p>
    This seal exacts unconditional obedience from high and low in all the
    Sultan’s dominions.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps you knew that?</p>
  <p>
    ” He smiled a queer smile, stared before him with a twitching face, and went
    on, “Perhaps you know too that the Sultan’s square seal opens even the doors
    of the harem.
  </p>
  <p>There is nothing I cannot do as easily as if I were Suleiman himself.</p>
  <p>Do you understand what that means, Michael el-Hakim?</p>
  <p>
    ” I could only kneel before him, shake my head, and stammer, “No, no—I
    understand nothing—nothing!
  </p>
  <p>” “You see how I pass the time in my solitude.</p>
  <p>I read—I tell the chaplet of words.</p>
  <p>
    On the golden shelves of my treasury stands the assembled wisdom of all
    lands and all ages.
  </p>
  <p>I read and let the words flow past my eyes.</p>
  <p>
    On lonely evenings I can hear the sages speak together—famous generals,
    great rulers, cunning architects, and inspired poets, besides all the holy
    men who in their way are as possessed and inspired as the poets.
  </p>
  <p>All this wisdom is at my disposal—but how can it profit me now?</p>
  <p>I am Ibrahim the fortunate.</p>
  <p>My eyes have been opened and I see through all human prejudice.</p>
  <p>
    All this wisdom—hear what I say, Michael—all this wisdom is but words
    beautifully strung together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chosen with taste, no doubt, but words only—strings of words and nothing
    more.
  </p>
  <p>
    I, Ibrahim, alone of all men, have in my possession the personal seal of the
    Ruler of the World.
  </p>
  <p>And what do I do, Michael el-Hakim?</p>
  <p>You see me.</p>
  <p>
    In my lonely room I read words that have been beautifully strung together.
  </p>
  <p>” y y g g He drew off the magnificent rings, irked by their looseness.</p>
  <p>“He knows me and I know him.</p>
  <p>
    Twins could not divine one another’s thoughts more swiftly and completely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last night when he fell sick he handed me his seal, thereby delivering
    himself and his power into my hands.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps it was to show me his unshaken trust.</p>
  <p>But I know him no longer and cannot read his thoughts as I used to do.</p>
  <p>
    Then he was a mirror, but another has breathed upon that mirror and I cannot
    see what is in his mind.
  </p>
  <p>I can do nothing—I cannot save myself.</p>
  <p>His trust has stolen my strength and my will.</p>
  <p>
    ” Though he strove to master himself I saw his tremulous hands and twitching
    face, and as a physician I knew how sick must be his heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    I said soothingly, “Noble lord, the month of Ramadan has begun—a month as
    trying for rulers as for slaves.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the fast is over you will see all with other eyes and laugh at your
    hallucinations.
  </p>
  <p>
    You would do well to eat and drink your fill, visit your harem, and linger
    there until the new day of fasting and it is light enough to distinguish a
    black thread from a white.
  </p>
  <p>
    Experience had shown that pious vigil among the women of the harem has a
    soothing effect on the mind during Ramadan, and is prescribed by the Prophet
    himself.
  </p>
  <p>” He looked at me from out of his despair.</p>
  <p>“How can I eat or drink when because of his sickness my lord must fast?</p>
  <p>
    He is not my lord, he is my heart’s brother, and I have never felt it so
    strongly as at the beginning of this Ramadan.
  </p>
  <p>My heart’s brother and my only true friend on earth.</p>
  <p>
    For years I forgot this, arrogantly enjoying his gifts and his infinite
    favor.
  </p>
  <p>
    While his cruel father Selim lived we rode side by side and the dark wings
    of death hovered over our heads.
  </p>
  <p>He trusted me then—he knew I was ready at any moment to die for him.</p>
  <p>But now his trust is gone.</p>
  <p>Were it not so he would not have given me this seal.</p>
  <p>He did it only to convince himself.</p>
  <p>He is a singular man, Michael.</p>
  <p>But why speak of that?</p>
  <p>It is all too late.</p>
  <p>
    My clock loses more and more and I have nothing to do but read words that
    have been beautifully strung together.
  </p>
  <p>
    For my eyes are still alive—” He could sit still no longer, but rose to pace
    back and forth restlessly, the sound of his steps muffled by the gorgeous
    Oriental rugs.
  </p>
  <p>He cried out in despair, “My clock is losing!</p>
  <p>It has been slow from the first hour.</p>
  <p>
    The clocks of Europe tick more quickly than the best clocks of the East.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever I dreamed, desired, hoped, and even achieved, I heard only the
    answer of my dragging clock—’Too late, too late.
  </p>
  <p>’ It was too late before Vienna.</p>
  <p>Too late in Bagdad, too late in Tabriz.</p>
  <p>Khaireddin came too late.</p>
  <p>Whatever I have done or decided—all has been too late.</p>
  <p>
    ” Blood was mounting to his head and his eyes were suffused with it as he
    stared at me.
  </p>
  <p>“Allah, what can one man do!</p>
  <p>What armies of prejudice have I not had to fight, every moment!</p>
  <p>
    Everything I have achieved, every law I have made, has been met with hatred
    and y ridicule.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet when at length all opposition was vanquished the answer was the
    same—’’Too late!
  </p>
  <p>
    ’ Only yesterday in my foolish conceit I could fancy no greater bitterness
    than this.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now at the beginning of Ramadan, as I sit reading words, I no longer
    care to defy my destiny.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” His arms fell limply and his face, beautiful in its pallor, became calm
    and peaceful.
  </p>
  <p>
    An almost mischievous smile played over his lips as he said, “One of the
    Roman emperors sighed, when he was at the point of death, ‘What an actor the
    world loses in me!
  </p>
  <p>’ But I can hardly call myself even an actor.</p>
  <p>
    For the sake of our friendship I have so renounced myself that I hardly know
    when I’m acting and when I’m in earnest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Too much power turns a man into an actor—above all if that power is
    dependent on the will and favor of another, though that other be the most
    excellent man in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet I know that it is the same with him and perhaps even worse, for after
    all that has happened he will never be entirely sincere with anyone.
  </p>
  <p>He must choose every word and control every change of expression.</p>
  <p>
    Michael, Michael, he will suffer worse than I, and he will never know which
    is truth and which is falsehood in his own heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so I shudder for him, knowing how hideously alone he will be in the
    world.
  </p>
  <p>God, Allah, unknown tempter!</p>
  <p>Whoever You be, You cannot deny our friendship.</p>
  <p>” He fell silent and listened, shocked, to the echo of his voice.</p>
  <p>Then he whispered, “No man can trust his neighbor.</p>
  <p>That is the only enduring truth; there is none other in the world.</p>
  <p>
    ” “Noble lord,” I said, “too great mistrust is as bad as overconfidence.
  </p>
  <p>Both are disastrous in their effects.</p>
  <p>We should in all things seek the golden mean.</p>
  <p>
    ” The Grand Vizier looked at me scornfully and asked, “Is that unpleasant
    woman seeking, through you, to lull me once more into a false sense of
    security before the blow falls?
  </p>
  <p>What do women know of friendship?</p>
  <p>
    Listen carefully, Michael—if there is on earth a devil in human shape it is
    that woman.
  </p>
  <p>
    But she has only a woman’s understanding; she judges the world by herself
    and therefore could never see why the Sultan gave me the seal and its
    sovereign powers.
  </p>
  <p>Take her this greeting from me, Michael.</p>
  <p>
    To her life’s end she will never succeed in cracking that nut, and nothing
    angers a woman more than the discovery that in the relationship between man
    and man there are things that women can never understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He surveyed me proudly with his brilliant eyes and seemed to me at that
    moment as beautiful as a fallen angel.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a gesture that waved away my attempts at contradiction, he said,
    “Perhaps you know that last night I dined with the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The more poison is dropped into his ear the more eager is he to keep me by
    him, to watch my thoughts and scrutinize my face.
  </p>
  <p>I chose for him as is fitting the best fruit in the dish.</p>
  <p>
    He peeled and ate it, and a quarter of g p q an hour had barely passed when
    he felt a burning in his stomach and fancied he was going to die on the
    spot.
  </p>
  <p>He thought I had poisoned him.</p>
  <p>
    Exhausted by the emetics of the physicians he nevertheless realized that he
    would live, and looking me straight in the eye he handed me his personal
    seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way he thought to bind me to him and prevent me from doing him harm.
  </p>
  <p>
    No stranger could understand his action, but ever since our boyhood I have
    shared his meals, slept beneath the same roof, and been his closest friend,
    until that fatal woman induced him to shut his heart from me.
  </p>
  <p>You spoke of too great mistrust, and I have reproached myself for it.</p>
  <p>
    But when with the sweat of terror on my brow I saw him poisoned I knew that
    the Russian woman had bewitched the fruit in my hand to cast suspicion upon
    me.
  </p>
  <p>Roxelana is no fool.</p>
  <p>I ate of the fruit—I ordered the slaves to eat the rest.</p>
  <p>Neither I nor they sickened.</p>
  <p>Only in the fruit I chose for him was there poison.</p>
  <p>Can you imagine anything more devilish than that?</p>
  <p>” I shook my head compassionately.</p>
  <p>“You are ill, lord.</p>
  <p>Your poisoned fancy has given you these notions.</p>
  <p>
    An infectious stomach disorder is rife in the city, and I myself fell sick
    the day before yesterday after eating apples.
  </p>
  <p>I beg you, lord, to drink this soothing medicine that I have brought.</p>
  <p>You need sleep— you need to forget your clock.</p>
  <p>” “So, you would give me a soothing drink, Michael el-Hakim!</p>
  <p>That, then, was the object of your visit.</p>
  <p>When you denied your Christ you did it to save your own miserable life.</p>
  <p>
    This time no doubt you have been offered more than thirty pieces of silver.
  </p>
  <p>You see, I know the Christian Scriptures.</p>
  <p>
    ” Looking him in the eyes I answered, “Grand Vizier Ibrahim, I’m a poor man
    indeed, for I suppose I have neither God nor holy book on which I may swear
    a binding oath.
  </p>
  <p>But you I have never betrayed, and never shall.</p>
  <p>
    Not for your sake, but for mine—though I cannot hope you will understand
    that, since I hardly understand it myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps to prove to myself that I, renegade and backslider, can be loyal to
    at least one person in the world and stand by his side in time of need.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Despite the conflict within him I believe my words made their impression,
    and when he had sat for some time gazing searchingly into my eyes he rose,
    walked over to a chest with a golden lid, threw it open and tossed out onto
    the floor a number of purses so stuffed with coin that the thin leather
    split and the pieces rolled over the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the heap of purses he threw handfuls of pearls, rubies, sapphires,
    emeralds, and other stones; not even at Khaireddin’s arrival had I beheld so
    much gold and so many sparkling jewels gathered together in one place.
  </p>
  <p>“Michael el-Hakim!</p>
  <p>
    As sure as I am that there was poison in the fruit the Sultan ate, so sure
    am I that you are a betrayer.
  </p>
  <p>I ask only to know the truth.</p>
  <p>Not even the Russian can pay you so princely a sum as I can.</p>
  <p>
    Tell me the whole truth, Michael, and you shall take all this treasure away.
  </p>
  <p>This time no mutes stand behind the curtain.</p>
  <p>Truth alone can bring some relief to my burdened mind.</p>
  <p>
    The swiftest galley and a hundred sea janissaries shall take you to what
    country you please.
  </p>
  <p>Only have pity, Michael, and tell me the truth.</p>
  <p>
    ” I stared as if bewitched at the dazzling heap, but soon with a bitter
    taste in my mouth I said, “My lord Ibrahim, if I were to tell you that I am
    a betrayer you would believe it because you want to believe it.
  </p>
  <p>But I cannot confess to what is not true.</p>
  <p>
    Let me kiss your hand in farewell and go, and no longer plague you with my
    presence.
  </p>
  <p>” “If indeed you are loyal to me you’re simpler than I thought.</p>
  <p>In the world of statecraft, loyalty is a form of idiocy.</p>
  <p>
    ” I found the word of release and said smiling, “Then let us be two
    blockheads in the same boat.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are even more foolish than I, for you wear the Sultan’s personal seal
    and yet refuse to use it to save yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The Grand Vizier stared at me, and his eyes were weary with the struggle
    that rent his soul.
  </p>
  <p>His face was ashy pale and a dull film seemed to veil his eyes.</p>
  <p>In a lifeless voice he said, “Why, why do you stay by me?</p>
  <p>Are you bound to me by gratitude?</p>
  <p>It cannot be true.</p>
  <p>
    There is no more thankless creature than man, for unlike the beasts man
    hates his benefactor.
  </p>
  <p>Tell me why you will not desert me.</p>
  <p>
    ” I kissed his hand with veneration, sat cross legged on the floor before
    him with my head in my hand, and thought about myself and my life, and about
    him and his.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a long time we sat in silence, and then I said, “The question is not
    easy to answer.
  </p>
  <p>It must be because of the love I bear you, noble lord.</p>
  <p>
    Not for your gifts to me, but because you have sometimes spoken to me and
    treated me as if I were a reasoning being.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love you for your beauty, your intelligence, your pride, your doubts, and
    your wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>Your like has hardly been seen upon this earth.</p>
  <p>It is true that you have your faults.</p>
  <p>
    You’re jealous of your power—you’re a spendthrift, a blasphemer, and many
    other things that people blame you for.
  </p>
  <p>But none of this affects my feelings for you.</p>
  <p>
    No one hates you for your human failings, Grand Vizier Ibrahim, though they
    like to talk of them and magnify them, to justify to themselves and to their
    fellows the malice they bear you.
  </p>
  <p>
    They detest you only because you stand so high above other men, and that is
    something that mediocre souls can never endure.
  </p>
  <p>And yet in each one of us lies the latent faculty of surpassing others.</p>
  <p>Of that I am sure.</p>
  <p>
    “Perhaps I love you best for your high aims and motives and for never
    behaving with deliberate cruelty to anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to you no one in the Sultan’s dominions is persecuted for his faith,
    be he Christian or Jew.
  </p>
  <p>Do you wonder that men hate you, Grand Vizier Ibrahim?</p>
  <p>But because of these things I love you.</p>
  <p>
    ” He listened with a tired smile, as if mocking himself and admiring my
    talent for stringing words so pleasantly together.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tiptoed from the room and fetched the tray of covered dishes that servants
    had prepared, setting it beside him, lifting the silver lids and tasting a
    little of all the food to reassure him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abstractedly he began to eat, and when I gave him the sleeping draught he
    took it without demur.
  </p>
  <p>
    I held his hand until he slept, kissed it once more respectfully, and then
    replaced all the money and jewels in the chest so as not to expose the
    servants to too great temptation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I called these men and ordered them to undress their lord and carry him to
    bed, and they obeyed me with gladness, having felt deep concern for the
    sleeplessness that the Grand Vizier had so long suffered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three days afterward Mustafa ben-Nakir appeared, unexpectedly, as was his
    custom.
  </p>
  <p>
    I feared the worst, for he seemed to bring with him a breath of cold menace.
  </p>
  <p>
    The silver bells at his knees rang as pleasantly as ever, but he was less
    carefully dressed and less clean than he was wont to be.
  </p>
  <p>He had even forgotten the Persian book.</p>
  <p>
    I asked where he had been and what he had been doing, and he said, “Let us
    go down to your marble quay and watch the stars come out.
  </p>
  <p>
    A poem is about to be born in my heart and I do not want your servants or
    even your wife to be present at this solemn moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” When we had made our way down to the water’s edge, Mustafa ben-Nakir
    looked about him and asked, “Where is your brother Antar the wrestler?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I replied impatiently that I knew little of his movements, because since
    our return from Tunis he had gone barefoot, let his hair grow, and spent
    days together among the dervishes, watching their magic arts and listening
    to the shameless tales with which they beguiled credulous women into giving
    them money.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet I called him and he emerged reluctantly from the boathouse, gnawing a
    bone.
  </p>
  <p>“Ah, Antar, do you think to join our brotherhood?</p>
  <p>” asked Mustafa ben-Nakir in wonder at his appearance.</p>
  <p>
    Andy stared at him oafishly with his round gray eyes and said, “You see I
    have no lionskin over my shoulders.
  </p>
  <p>
    But my aim has indeed been to seek God upon the moun- taintops and in the
    desert.
  </p>
  <p>
    How could you guess my thoughts, when I have not hinted them even to the
    dervishes?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Mustafa ben-Nakir was so greatly astonished that he touched brow and
    ground with his finger tips at Andy’s feet.
  </p>
  <p>“In truth,” he said, “Allah is great and marvelous are his ways.</p>
  <p>This is the last thing I should have expected.</p>
  <p>Tell me what has led you to seek the holy path.</p>
  <p>
    ” Andy seated himself on the edge of the landing stage and dipped his weary
    feet into the water, gnawing meanwhile at his bone.
  </p>
  <p>“How am I to explain to you what I hardly understand myself?</p>
  <p>
    While I had my friend Michael’s little dog beside me I felt a better
    creature.
  </p>
  <p>Rael hated no one and at once forgave all wrongs.</p>
  <p>
    If when I was drunk I happened to tread on his paws and make him yelp with
    pain, he’d come up to me at once to lick me as if asking forgiveness for
    having got in the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    He took the blame for my mistake, though over and over again I tried to
    explain the foolishness of this.
  </p>
  <p>On cold nights Rael would keep me warm.</p>
  <p>But who rightly values happiness and friendship before they’re gone?</p>
  <p>
    Not until that good dog found his well-deserved reward in the Seraglio did I
    see how much Michael and I had lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He wiped away a few tears and went on, “Now that sorrow has found me I can
    see that the little dog was wiser than I; I see at last that I bear the
    guilt of the world’s evil.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whenever I see a man do an evil or a cruel deed I say to myself, the fault
    is yours!
  </p>
  <p>
    Alas, I’m a simple man and would do best to betake myself to a mountaintop
    or a desert, for these new thoughts of mine seem greatly to irritate other
    people, and I think I shall never again go to war.
  </p>
  <p>If I do it must be for some good and righteous cause.</p>
  <p>
    ” “I can offer you a good cause at this moment,” said Mustafa benNakir
    eagerly.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Move away out of earshot and guard us against eavesdroppers; make short
    work of them if they appear.
  </p>
  <p>A poem is about to be born in my heart.</p>
  <p>
    ” Andy answered good naturedly, “I’m an ignorant fellow, yet I understand
    the anguish of such a birth.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I’ve noticed too that wine can allay much of it, and I will fetch
    Michael’s largest wine jar from the cellar.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” When he had gone, Mustafa ben-Nakir at once began, “I’ve been in the city
    to perform certain devotional exercises, and at the same time I heard news.
  </p>
  <p>There was also a story being told which I shall now repeat to you.</p>
  <p>
    ” In vain I protested that I was in no mood for stories and would prefer to
    hear his errand in plain language.
  </p>
  <p>
    He insisted in injured tones that ill tidings must be wrapped in silk, and
    in the name of the Compassionate he went on, “There was once a rich and
    respected lord whose falconer was a handsome youth of the same age as
    himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The master became exceedingly fond of his servant and believed him as
    honorable as he was handsome, but when he would have entrusted him with the
    stewardship of his household, the guileful servant protested, saying, ‘It is
    not easy to govern so large a g p y g y g g household.
  </p>
  <p>
    What surety have I that one day my lord will not be wroth with me and take
    off my head?
  </p>
  <p>’ The honorable master laughed and said, ‘I, wroth with thee?</p>
  <p>Thy friendship is more to me than the sight of my eyes.</p>
  <p>
    Yet, since neither of us can see into the future, I swear by the Prophet and
    the Koran that I will never dismiss or punish thee for any error.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather I will protect and shield thee with all the power that Allah has
    given me, all the days of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    ’ “Not many years had passed before the slave squandered his master’s
    substance and endangered his house by forming connections in the teeth of
    law and custom.
  </p>
  <p>
    All too late the noble lord perceived his mistake and would have punished
    the slave who had so basely abused his trust, but he was a devout man and
    could not break his oath.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slave, who after the manner of slaves hated and envied his master
    because of his noble nature, crept to his bedside one night, strangled him,
    and sold his house and possessions to the unbeliever, thus doing not only
    his master but all Islam irreparable harm.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Mustafa ben-Nakir fell silent, and in the blue darkness I saw the glitter
    of his eyes.
  </p>
  <p>He added coolly, “Is not that a strange story?</p>
  <p>What would you have done, Michael, in that noble master’s place?</p>
  <p>” “Allah, what a foolish question!</p>
  <p>
    I would have hastened to the Mufti and asked him for a fatwa to release me
    from my rash oath.
  </p>
  <p>That is what a mufti is for.</p>
  <p>” “Exactly!</p>
  <p>” whispered Mustafa.</p>
  <p>“This very morning the story has been told to the Mufti.</p>
  <p>
    He has been asked to prepare a fatwa, in return for which Sultan Suleiman
    has promised to build the most splendid mosque ever seen, at the highest
    point of the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fatwa frees him from the sacred oath that he swore in the folly of his
    youth, and he can now act without offending against the laws of the Koran.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I was silent, for the significance of the story had already dawned upon
    me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier’s fate was irrevocably sealed, and no one in the world
    could help him now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mustafa ben-Nakir covertly watched my face in the blue twilight and became
    impatient.
  </p>
  <p>“Why don’t you speak, Michael?</p>
  <p>Are you as simple as your brother Antar?</p>
  <p>The opportunity will slip through our fingers.</p>
  <p>The Mufti has been given until tomorrow evening to consider.</p>
  <p>
    Tomorrow is the Ides of March, according to the Christian calendar, when all
    notable events are wont to take place.
  </p>
  <p>The time for action has come.</p>
  <p>
    The Ides of March favor the bold man, but crush the weak and vacillating
    beneath an iron heel.
  </p>
  <p>” “If by action you mean that we must fly, it is too late.</p>
  <p>
    In any case I will not desert the Grand Vizier in his most desperate hour,
    however foolish this may seem in the eyes of the prudent/’ Mustafa ben-Nakir
    cried impatiently, “Are you asleep, Michael?
  </p>
  <p>Sultan Suleiman is unlit to be lord of the world.</p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier carries the Sultan’s personal seal, and the Seraglio knows
    that Suleiman has been sick for some days.
  </p>
  <p>The janissaries love Prince Mustafa.</p>
  <p>
    The Young Moor is wintering here with his ships, and all we need is a large
    enough sum to distribute among the janissaries, rosy promises for the
    people, and larger farms for the spahis.
  </p>
  <p>Then the Seraglio would joyfully proclaim Prince Mustafa sultan.</p>
  <p>Michael, Michael!</p>
  <p>Destiny unaided has prepared all things for tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
    ” “But,” I asked in amazement, “what do you mean to do with Sultan Suleiman?
  </p>
  <p>” “He must die, of course,” said Mustafa in surprise.</p>
  <p>“One of those two must die, as you must see for yourself.</p>
  <p>
    When the Sultan has obtained his fatwa he will invite the Grand Vizier to an
    evening meal with him, but this time the meal will end with the coming of
    the mutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before this, however, will be the Grand Vizier’s moment—the only moment and
    the last.
  </p>
  <p>They eat together; then poison, dagger, or noose will speak.</p>
  <p>The Sultan’s face can be painted to conceal all signs of violence.</p>
  <p>
    And in any event, after his death the people will be thinking more about
    young Mustafa than about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” My thoughts took a bold flight, and after my long depression and apathy I
    was fired with enthusiasm; for reason told me that Mustafa’s plan was
    excellent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the deed was done neither janissaries nor eunuchs would ask needless
    questions; they would quickly submit to the will of Allah and hasten forward
    to receive from the heir the gifts to be expected at the beginning of a new
    reign.
  </p>
  <p>Meanwhile the cannon of the Young Moor would command the city.</p>
  <p>
    Should any pasha of the Divan be foolish enough to demand an inquiry, his
    colleagues would hasten to suppress him in the hope of seizing his
    appointment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I myself would lose nothing by the altered regime, whereas if the Grand
    Vizier were to die a traitor’s death at the hands of the mutes, my own head
    would soon roll into the vaults beneath the Gateway of Peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tradition would require the distribution of a large number of black kaftans
    among the Grand Vizier’s adherents and servants.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had already drunk deeply of the wine that Andy had set down within reach,
    and now I said, “Your health, Mustafa ben-Nakir!
  </p>
  <p>Your plan is excellent but you have not yet told me all.</p>
  <p>Be honest for once and say why you’re risking your neck.</p>
  <p>
    I know you and your philosophy well enough to be sure that you wouldn’t lift
    a finger for the Grand Vizier alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” By the light of the rising moon I saw him incline his head toward mine.
  </p>
  <p>
    He seized the wine jar and drank, then said rapidly, “Ah, Michael my friend!
  </p>
  <p>
    Though I sought solace among the fair daughters of Bagdad how could I find
    it, when in her I had learned to adore the unattainable?
  </p>
  <p>
    I must be freed from this phantom, for reason tells me that she is but a
    woman like other women.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I can only win to this release in her arms, which is possible only if
    Sultan Suleiman dies and I can claim her as my reward.
  </p>
  <p>It is as simple as that.</p>
  <p>
    For the sake of a woman’s rippling laugh the goddess of history will
    tomorrow turn a fresh page in her great book.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He hid his face in his hands and his whole body shook with passion, pain,
    and the sorcery that wine and the cool spring night had wrought.
  </p>
  <p>
    Andy approached, commiserated with him on the birth pangs of his poem, and
    helped him to his feet, though he too was so unsteady that they nearly
    tumbled into the water together.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Mustafa had released himself from Andy’s arms he seized me by the
    shoulders and muttered thickly, “You know enough, Michael el-Hakim!
  </p>
  <p>Hasten now to him who is in both our thoughts.</p>
  <p>
    When he has promised to do his part we will make all ready for tomorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Andy helped Mustafa away to bed and then at my orders put on a clean
    kaftan to attend me, for I dared not set forth alone on so perilous an
    errand.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the sleepy slaves were preparing the boat, Giulia came hurrying down
    to the landing stage, wringing her hands and weeping.
  </p>
  <p>“Don’t leave me alone, Michael!</p>
  <p>What has happened and what did Mustafa ben-Nakir want of you?</p>
  <p>And whither are you bound?</p>
  <p>You would not hide anything rrom me?</p>
  <p>
    ” I told her that Mustafa ben-Nakir had drunk himself insensible while
    composing a poem in honor of a certain exalted lady, but that I, being
    unable to sleep, was on my way to the great mosque to watch and pray.
  </p>
  <p>
    She told me that she too was sleepless and begged me to take her with me,
    that she might seek the company of the harem ladies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not refuse, yet it was without pleasure than I took my place beside
    her beneath the stern awning; indeed, I was surprised at my own sudden
    antipathy to her presence.
  </p>
  <p>Chancing to brush against her I felt that she was trembling.</p>
  <p>“Are you cold, Giulia?</p>
  <p>” I asked in wonder.</p>
  <p>
    Then as she drew away from me, I turned my eyes to Alberto’s dark,
    expressionless face.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remembered Giulia’s cat, and many other things, until I too began to
    tremble.
  </p>
  <p>“That Tunisian drug,” I said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>“Why did you put it in the fruit you gave me some days ago?</p>
  <p>I had no need of it; I was quite well.</p>
  <p>
    ” My calm tones lured her into the trap, for scheming though her nature was
    she often saw no farther than the end of her nose.
  </p>
  <p>“Ah, Michael, you’re not angry with me?</p>
  <p>It was for your good.</p>
  <p>
    You looked unwell and I feared you might have caught the boatman’s sickness.
  </p>
  <p>I could not guess it would make you so ill.</p>
  <p>
    ” After this admission I knew for certain that Sultana Khurrem had heard of
    the drug and begged her to obtain some of it.
  </p>
  <p>But Giulia had wanted first to try it out on me.</p>
  <p>
    It was clear that in such a matter the Sultana could not approach the
    Seraglio physicians.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Giulia was her confidante, and the very next evening the drug was in
    Khurrem’s hands, to be skillfully introduced into the finest of the fruits
    destined for the Sultan’s dessert.
  </p>
  <p>
    Courtesy, of course, required the Grand Vizier to offer the Sultan this very
    fruit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite this new evidence of Giulia’s treachery I felt no particular anger.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps it had consumed itself.</p>
  <p>Indeed the certainty brought me something approaching relief.</p>
  <p>
    No more was said, and when we came alongside the Seraglio quay I set her and
    Alberto ashore before proceeding further to the end of the street leading to
    the great mosque.
  </p>
  <p>
    From here Andy and I could walk unnoticed uphill toward the Atmeidan and
    then follow the high wall surrounding the forbidden gardens.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I entered the Grand Vizier’s palace by a back entrance, Andy remained
    on guard in the street.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was taken straight to the Grand Vizier, who was sitting in his library on
    a plain leather cushion, holding a Greek parchment in his hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    He smiled pleasantly and said, “My clock is slow, and so I am not at all
    surprised to see you at so late an hour.
  </p>
  <p>” This time he was singularly well and carefully dressed.</p>
  <p>His hair was oiled and his hands and nails colored.</p>
  <p>
    He had even put red on his lips and wore earrings set with sparkling
    diamonds, and seemed to have regained his usual serenity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wasting no time on preliminary courtesies I said, “Noble lord, your clock is
    not slow.
  </p>
  <p>
    I fancy that someone has bribed your clockmaker or the Sultan’s to put it
    deliberately out of order, for you to take it as a bad omen.
  </p>
  <p>But your clock is not slow, happy Ibrahim.</p>
  <p>Indeed, it gains upon that of your enemies.</p>
  <p>
    ” I told him rapidly of all I had learned—of the poison in the fruit, of the
    fatwa, of Mustafa ben-Nakir’s plan, and of his brotherhood that stood ready
    to give Ibrahim the Grand Master their support.
  </p>
  <p>
    “All is in readiness and nothing remains for you to do but to grasp the
    rudder of events.
  </p>
  <p>Strike first!</p>
  <p>
    Remember that where you are concerned the Sultan is nothing but an assassin.
  </p>
  <p>You eat alone together, and you are certainly stronger than he.</p>
  <p>
    You can take no weapon with you, but you can strangle him with the chain of
    the square seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one will suspect that of being the means of death, however carefully they
    search your clothes.
  </p>
  <p>But first strike him a heavy blow on the temple to keep him quiet.</p>
  <p>Be swift and bold and all will go well.</p>
  <p>Dominion of the empire awaits you—dominion perhaps of the whole world!</p>
  <p>
    ” He listened to me quietly and as if I were telling him some familiar tale.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I had finished, he said softly, “So, Michael el-Hakim, you’re a traitor
    after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    But why did you not poison me, when you had so good an opportunity, or at
    least rob me?
  </p>
  <p>But I have had the money counted and none is missing.</p>
  <p>Truly Allah’s creatures are strange in their diversity.</p>
  <p>There, do not weep!</p>
  <p>I would not for the world distress my only friend.</p>
  <p>
    ” He patted me lightly on the cheek with his warm hand and invited me to sit
    at his right side; he poured wine for me into a golden goblet and chose for
    me the best pieces from a dish before him, as if I had been an honored
    guest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having calmed me he went on, “You may be my friend, yet you do not know me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have long considered all you suggest, and the plan in itself is excellent.
  </p>
  <p>Yet there is one drawback.</p>
  <p>Myself.</p>
  <p>
    No one knows this but the Sultan, and he showed his knowledge of it in
    giving me his seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his heart he knows that our friendship binds me closer than iron fetters.
  </p>
  <p>No, I shall not murder him.</p>
  <p>
    Since his youth he has been a melancholy man, and sorrow will keep him even
    closer company when I am gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Henceforth terror will rule the Seraglio—and all because of the Russian.
  </p>
  <p>Deeply, deeply do I pity him.</p>
  <p>He will be the loneliest man in all the Empire.</p>
  <p>
    “You once said that a man must be loyal to at least one creature on earth.
  </p>
  <p>If you, then why not I?</p>
  <p>
    Man is greater than statecraft, honor, wealth, and power, though many will
    not see this.
  </p>
  <p>
    But let us be honest and admit that just as your loyalty to me is no more
    than loyalty to yourself, so is my loyalty to the Sultan nothing but loyalty
    to a certain poor Ibrahim who sits at his side, trying to persuade himself
    that he is a true man.
  </p>
  <p>The hour of parting is at hand, and we may doff our masks.</p>
  <p>
    ” For a long time we sat in silence until no doubt he wearied of my company,
    for he said politely, “If indeed you do not mean to run away, do me one last
    service and have my body buried decentiy, after the Moslem fashion.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I suspect that he made me this last request from sheer courtesy, to show
    his faith in me, for he can have cared little what became of his remains.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I promised to do as he asked and kissed his hand and shoulder in
    farewell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus I parted forever from the most notable and singular of all the men I
    have met, a greater man than either the Emperor or the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I emerged from the servants’ entrance I found Andy sitting in the
    street in the moonlight, singing a scurrilous German song.
  </p>
  <p>I said, “This is Ramadan, my dear Andy.</p>
  <p>Let us go to the great mosque to pray.</p>
  <p>
    ” As with slippers in hand we stepped through the great copper gates and in
    among the porphyry pillars, peace entered my heart as softly and gently as
    my bare feet sank into the rich carpets on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only a few lamps were burning, and above them the vast dome soared up like
    the night sky.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mosque was empty, but soon the feast of Bairam would come, when on the
    last night of Ramadan the hundred lamps would burn, the gilded texts would
    gleam from the giant medallions, and tens of thousands of Moslems would
    crowd under the great dome to hear the Koran read aloud from the throne of
    the Imams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sultan Suleiman himself would be present, and behind the golden grille the
    ladies of the harem would follow the ceremonial, among them the devout
    Sultana Khurrem with Giulia at her side.
  </p>
  <p>But I should not share in the rejoicing.</p>
  <p>
    Along subterranean conduits my headless body would be sluggishly moving
    toward the Marmara.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beneath a solitary lamp I pressed my forehead to the soft rug, rose, and
    once more prostrated myself before the face of Allah.
  </p>
  <p>
    But above all I directed my prayers to the incorruptible judge within
    myself, begging for strength to leave my imprisoning body without fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    The crescent moon was dipping into cloud as the boat touched our landing
    stage and we stepped ashore.
  </p>
  <p>Giulia had not returned, nor was the skulking Alberto to be seen.</p>
  <p>Mustafa ben-Nakir still lay in profound slumber on my bed.</p>
  <p>
    I resolved to take advantage of the moment and said to Andy, “I want to
    speak to you seriously, so don’t interrupt me with foolish questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tomorrow, the next day, or at latest in three days’ time I shall be a dead
    man.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I am a slave of the Sultan’s, my house and possessions revert to him,
    though through the favor she enjoys Giulia may be able to secure a lawful
    settlement.
  </p>
  <p>She is a free woman.</p>
  <p>And you, Andy, are a free man; I have seen to that.</p>
  <p>
    Your share of Muley-Hassan’s diamonds is in my care and after my death
    you’re to have my share, too.
  </p>
  <p>No one knows of these stones.</p>
  <p>Now is our chance to bury them in the garden.</p>
  <p>
    After my death, after the auction that will be held here, and when I have
    been quite forgotten—that will be at most a week, if I know the Seraglio—you
    can dig them up and sell the smallest of them to a reliable Jew for your
    journey money.
  </p>
  <p>I will give you his name later.</p>
  <p>
    The wisest thing you can do is to go to Egypt and seek the protection of the
    good eunuch Suleiman.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can either sail with him to India or, if he advises it, return to Venice
    and the Christian countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    You would do best to leave this house early tomorrow and stay for the time
    with the dervishes, for Moslems treat their holy men and other eccentrics
    well and do not persecute them.
  </p>
  <p>” Andy stared at me with an expressionless face.</p>
  <p>
    Then sighing deeply he said, “Allah truly is the one God, though at times I
    have doubted his sanity, peace be with him.
  </p>
  <p>I hear and I obey, and will pack up and go to Egypt if need be.</p>
  <p>
    But there’s a time for everything and I shall not give up until I have seen
    your head fall with my own eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    No, I shall not leave you, though they should crack my skull for it—if they
    can.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I rebuked him; I sought with both harsh and gentle words to persuade him.
  </p>
  <p>
    But he was obdurate, and I could do nothing but thank him irritably for his
    friendship and then hurry down with him to bury the diamonds.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time we returned from this task, one could distinguish a black thread
    from a white, and a new day in Ramadan was beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of the sacred laws we went at once to rest, and with the peace of
    renunciation in my heart I sank into a profound p y p slumber.
  </p>
  <p>
    I lay thus until roused by Mustafa ben-Nakir, who hung over me with tousled
    hair and his lionskin askew over his shoulders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rising quickly I washed and dressed without a word, and at the sight of my
    face he too held his peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then unwilling to keep him longer in suspense I told him of what had passed.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I spoke his face grew ever darker, though like a wise man he allowed no
    needless ejaculation to escape his lips—a circumstance greatly to his
    credit, for who else could have listened without cursing to the story of the
    crazed obstinacy with which the Grand Vizier had thrust aside our helping
    hands?
  </p>
  <p>
    When I had ended, Mustafa benNakir began in his turn to wash himself, dye
    his hands, and anoint his head.
  </p>
  <p>“Grand Vizier Ibrahim has condemned himself,” he said at last.</p>
  <p>“It is easy to be mistaken in people.</p>
  <p>
    But now both your neck and mine are in danger, and no one will thank us for
    following Ibrahim to his death like sheep.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us save our skins and cleanse ourselves from blame by testifying against
    him.
  </p>
  <p>
    No further harm can come to him through that, since the Sultan has already
    pronounced his doom by appealing to the Mufti.
  </p>
  <p>” “Allah, Allah!</p>
  <p>” I cried aghast.</p>
  <p>“May your name be accursed if ever you do such a thing.</p>
  <p>
    ” He looked at me in wonder and said coldly, “I have my position and my work
    to do in the world, and the cornerstone of statesmanship is realism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wise man abstains from vain struggle and joins the victor, so as to
    claim his share in the spoils.
  </p>
  <p>
    The turncoat is often in a better position than the conqueror, for he knows
    more and can sell his knowledge at a higher price.
  </p>
  <p>” I gazed into his shining eyes and beautiful face.</p>
  <p>“No,” I said softly.</p>
  <p>“I follow you no longer, Mustafa ben-Nakir.</p>
  <p>I have had enough of your doctrines.</p>
  <p>
    ” “Then you’re a simpleton, Michael el-Hakim, and I’ve been mistaken in you.
  </p>
  <p>Remember that only stupidity is punished.</p>
  <p>
    Not lechery, nor greed, nor betrayal, nor apostasy, but stupidity alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    And truth is the worst stupidity, for only the feeble-minded thinks he has
    found truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we will speak no more of this, and I will not seek to persuade a man as
    simple as you.
  </p>
  <p>” “You’re right, son of the angel of death,” I answered.</p>
  <p>“All you have told me I have found out for myself.</p>
  <p>
    And so it is high time for me to prove that there is something greater in
    man than I used to think.
  </p>
  <p>This concerns only me, and you must forgive me if I now ask you to go.</p>
  <p>
    I’m weak and easily led, and should hate to betray myself at the last
    moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” A seductive smile overspread Mustafa ben-Nakir’s face, like sunlight on a
    shroud.
  </p>
  <p>“How can you be so sure that I am evil?</p>
  <p>
    How can you know that I am not the incorruptible judge within you, Michael
    el-Hakim?
  </p>
  <p>” His bright eyes seemed to pierce me through.</p>
  <p>
    How he came to speak of that incorruptible judge I could not understand, and
    his words filled me with such horror that I sank to my knees trembling.
  </p>
  <p>“Get thee behind me, Satan!</p>
  <p>” my lips murmured.</p>
  <p>But my heart was silent.</p>
  <p>Giulia swept into the room, having just returned from the Seraglio.</p>
  <p>
    She drew the thin veil from her face, revealing cheeks glowing with
    excitement and eyes lit with secret triumph.
  </p>
  <p>“Oh, Mustafa ben-Nakir!</p>
  <p>” she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“How fortunate that you’re still here.</p>
  <p>What will you give me for bringing you good tidings?</p>
  <p>
    ” “Torment me not, merciless Giulia, but tell me at once what you have to
    say.
  </p>
  <p>My heart is a leaf in the wind and my hands are ice.</p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia tittered and said, “A certain exalted person has heard of the poems
    you have carved in the bark of the plane trees in the janissaries’
    courtyard, and those you sent with the merchants from Basra.
  </p>
  <p>
    She laughs at your poems, but is flattered by your attention, and it may be
    that she is curious to see your face once more.
  </p>
  <p>Tonight favors a meeting of which none need know.</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps she will allow you to read your poems to her, for it’s said that
    during the nights of Ramadan women are full of whims.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hasten to the baths, Mustafa ben-Nakir, and let the attendants rub you with
    fragrant oils.
  </p>
  <p>
    At sunset, immediately after the hour of prayer, the forbidden door will
    open to you, and who knows what a night in Ramadan may hold in store?
  </p>
  <p>” “Don’t believe her!</p>
  <p>” I cried, deeply agitated.</p>
  <p>“This is nothing but a plot to get you out of the way.</p>
  <p>
    Fly to the monastery of your brotherhood, where none will dare to raise a
    hand against you.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia stamped and her eyes shot lightnings of rage as she screamed, “Hold
    your tongue, Michael!
  </p>
  <p>You have nothing to say in this matter.</p>
  <p>
    ” Mustafa ben-Nakir said, “Though it should mean death, yet she is and must
    ever be the only woman in the world for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps it is a plot, but when she has heard what I have to say she may
    change her mind.
  </p>
  <p>Ah, Michael!</p>
  <p>I should be mad not to take the opportunity so freely offered.</p>
  <p>
    An hour or so ago I was ready to overturn the Empire —nay, the world—only to
    touch her.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I must die I will do so gladly, once I have dispelled the illusion that
    the unattainable is worth striving for.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” When I went down to the landing stage with Mustafa ben-Nakir I saw to my
    surprise two blue-clad janissaries, who came in through the gate and began
    to follow me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then as I looked about me I beheld armed janissaries on guard at every
    entrance, in the garden, and j g y g down on the marble quay.
  </p>
  <p>By this I saw that Khurrem meant to leave nothing to chance.</p>
  <p>
    I lingered to watch Giulia glide away in my beautifully carved boat, Alberto
    standing beside her with folded arms and a sneer on his dark face.
  </p>
  <p>
    A cold hand seemed to clutch at my heart, and as I stood staring at the hazy
    roofs of the Seraglio across the water the onbash of the janissaries came up
    to me and bowed respectfully.
  </p>
  <p>The crossed ladles on his white felt cap glinted in the sun.</p>
  <p>
    Touching brow and ground with his finger tips he said, “I have been ordered
    by the Aga to accompany you everywhere and protect you against all evil.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am to answer for your safety with my head; therefore, do not be angered by
    my constant attendance.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this service the ambassadors of unbelievers pay three aspers a day to
    the janissaries and six to me—but such things vary with means and position
    and I have no doubt that you are greatly superior to the ambassadors of
    unbelievers.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” With a hopeful smile he twisted the ends of his long mustaches and looked
    admiringly at my turban, my earrings, and the buttons of my kaftan.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was nothing for it but to call down blessings on him and his men and
    to hand him a purse filled with aspers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Few days in my life have seemed so long and heavy as that brilliant Ides of
    March, but after an eternity I watched the sun sink toward the Seraglio and
    tinge the billows of the Bosphorus with red.
  </p>
  <p>
    I sought out Abu el-Kasim’s deaf-mute under the boatmen’s shed on the shore,
    explained to him by signs what I wanted, and bade him betake himself as
    usual to the janissaries’ courtyard by the Gateway of Peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    I slept not a wink all that night, and at dawn I ordered the sentries to
    wake the sleeping janissaries, with whom Andy and I then made the journey to
    the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>At the Gateway of Peace I found my faithful deaf-mute keeping watch.</p>
  <p>
    At my coming he stepped forward and told me with eager signs that the Grand
    Vizier had come to the Seraglio the evening before, dismissed his followers,
    and passed through the Gateway of Peace.
  </p>
  <p>He had not returned.</p>
  <p>
    A further gesture told me that my lord and friend was no more, and
    regardless of rank and dignity I sat down upon the ground to await the
    moment when the body of the murdered man would be thrown out into the
    courtyard.
  </p>
  <p>My attendant janissaries sat down also at a respectful distance.</p>
  <p>
    In the slowly growing light I saw the shrewd eyes of the onbash fixed upon
    me, but he asked no questions, knowing that our least actions are written in
    Allah’s great book long before our birth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Foolish curiosity was thus inconsistent with human dignity and selfrespect.
  </p>
  <p>
    The morning star faded, the cocks in the Seraglio forecourt began to crow,
    and soon the distant voice of the muezzin from the minaret of the great
    mosque reminded us that prayer is better than g q p y sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    The onbash roused the janissaries, and we moved off in single file to the
    tiled fountain, where we proclaimed our intention and in turn performed our
    ablutions.
  </p>
  <p>Then turning our faces toward the Holy City we said our prayers.</p>
  <p>
    Soon the sun rose over the spring landscape and the great gates swung wide
    open.
  </p>
  <p>
    The porter, yawning and scratching his back, replied to our wordless query
    by pointing at a bier that stood under the archway for relatives to fetch
    away.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I alone, the renegade, with Andy and the deaf-mute, came to take Grand
    Vizier Ibrahim on his last journey.
  </p>
  <p>Lying on that shabby bier he was less handsome than in life.</p>
  <p>
    His body was full of gaping wounds, and the green silk noose about his neck
    was drawn so tight that his face was black.
  </p>
  <p>
    His costly garments had been tossed pell mell over his naked body and the
    porter was even now removing them as his traditional perquisites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless he willingly sold me a black cloth in which to swathe the body.
  </p>
  <p>But it was too late.</p>
  <p>
    The janissaries who guarded me had already recognized him and could not
    restrain their cries of amazement and delight, though as a rule these men do
    not easily forget themselves and make it a point of honor to preserve
    impassive silence at all times.
  </p>
  <p>
    A crowd of others came to see what had happened, and soon the court
    resounded to excited chattering.
  </p>
  <p>
    I quickly gave the onbash the order to march and after only momentary
    hesitation he bowed, ordered four of his men to lift the bier, and took up
    his position in front of it, sending the other five on ahead to clear the
    way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moslems have great respect for the One who severs all the bonds of
    friendship, and once we had left the courtyard we could make our way in
    peace, unmolested by passers-by.
  </p>
  <p>
    We crossed the deserted Atmeidan and entered the Grand Vizier’s palace,
    where we laid the bier down before the famous clock in the great audience
    chamber.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was not at all surprised to see that the clock had at last stopped during
    the evening of the fatal Ides of March, Only a few frightened servants
    obeyed my angry summons and crept from their hiding places with bent heads.
  </p>
  <p>
    To them and to the eunuchs I gave orders that the Grand Vizier’s body should
    be arrayed in clean clothes and the face treated and colored to simulate the
    hues of life.
  </p>
  <p>Andy, meanwhile, went to find a hearse and a pair of horses.</p>
  <p>
    While he was gone a dignitary sent by the Mufti arrived to announce in
    formal terms that burial in any of the Moslem graveyards of a protector of
    unbelievers and grand master of a heretic sect could on no account be
    permitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was an unforeseen difficulty, but while I was pondering what to do the
    young poet Baki arrived at the palace in tears, careless of the danger he
    ran by displaying grief for the death of a man disgraced.
  </p>
  <p>
    He told me that the dervishes would gladly allow the body to be laid at
    their g y y sacred meeting place at Pera.
  </p>
  <p>if only to annoy the Mufti.</p>
  <p>I therefore sent him forward to arrange the matter with Murad-Asr/e£.</p>
  <p>
    Andy returned from the coach houses where he had found only a hay wagon, as
    all the Grand Vizier’s state carriages had been removed for fear of the
    Sultan’s wrath.
  </p>
  <p>
    With curses and threats he had forced the terrified grooms to harness to
    this a pair of night-black horses that had been used at the funeral of the
    Sultan’s mother a year or two before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I chose the finest carpets and silken covers in the house and with
    Andy’s help transformed the wagon into a splendid hearse.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I had laid the body of the Grand Vizier upon it—leaving his face
    uncovered for all to see, for the skillful eunuch had given it back its
    former proud look—I sprinkled over it many flasks of rose water and also a
    pot of musk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having nothing to lose but my head, and that only once, I resolved to be
    thorough in my defiance of the Sultan’s wrath.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore I ordered plumes to be fastened to the horses’ heads and fine
    pepper to be sprinkled in their eyes until the poor beasts wept copious
    tears, as at the funerals of sultans.
  </p>
  <p>
    Encouraged by my boldness, two Negro grooms put on mourning and offered to
    lead the animals.
  </p>
  <p>So, by our resolute action, the procession soon moved of!</p>
  <p>from the courtyard, headed by the onbash.</p>
  <p>
    His eyebrows were drawn fiercely together, his mustaches stood out stiffly,
    and he strutted and swung his staff of office as if he were a subash, at
    least.
  </p>
  <p>
    Andy and I walked with slow steps immediately behind the wagon, and we were
    followed by a few of Ibrahim’s faithful old retainers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime a crowd of silent onlookers had filled the Atmeidan, and had
    any ill-wisher taken it into his head to send agitators among them it might
    have gone badly with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    But all was deathly still; none dared molest us, and reverence for the dark,
    hovering wings held all decent Moslems motionless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus we crossed the Atmeidan unhindered, and the crowds fell in behind us
    until it seemed as if all Istanbul in deep, wordless grief meant to follow
    Grand Vizier Ibrahim to his grave.
  </p>
  <p>
    At last we reached the great wall near the Adrianople Gate, where we turned
    our steps toward the shore and crossed the Arsenal Bridge to the Pera
    quarter, on the opposite side of the Golden Horn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The silent crowds halted at the bridge, but at the other end of it the
    dervishes were already waiting, led by Murad-Af
  </p>
  <p>
    /f£, and beneath the sacred if somewhat notorious banner of their
    brotherhood they escorted us to their monastery at the top of the hill.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of them whirled in wild mourning dances, while those with the shrillest
    voices sang laments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The professional mourning women who had long led the procession were now
    filled with emulous rivalry, scratching their faces till the blood flowed
    and tearing their hair as they uttered fiercer and fiercer howls.
  </p>
  <p>
    y Thus it was that contrary to all expectation the Grand Vizier’s funeral
    procession proved an effective spectacle and one worthy of his standing,
    despite the short time at our disposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    I fancy that Sultana Khurrem never bargained for such a thing, but rather
    hoped that the janissaries would desecrate the hated body in the forecourt
    and rend it in pieces, as had been known to happen before.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the grave was dug and lined with the costly rugs and silks from the hay
    wagon, I took my lord Ibrahim’s body in my arms and laid him down for his
    last sleep, with his face toward the Holy City and his right hand under his
    cheek, that all requirements for a decent burial might be fulfilled.
  </p>
  <p>
    We then quickly filled in the grave, and to my delight the fragrance of musk
    floated up through the soil.
  </p>
  <p>Here on the mound I planted a young plane tree.</p>
  <p>
    Such trees live to be many hundreds of years old, and I hoped that this one
    would stand as a memorial to the Grand Vizier long after the capricious
    dervishes had abandoned the place.
  </p>
  <p>With this I felt that my task was fully accomplished.</p>
  <p>I therefore took a tender leave of Murad-to7</p>
  <p>
    £, thanking him for his friendship and calling down many blessings upon his
    head.
  </p>
  <p>
    My deaf-mute slave, who had followed the procession as inconspicuously as
    possible so as not to bring shame and ridicule upon it by his appearance,
    now approached and signed to me to hasten home.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began to suspect that his fellow mutes were awaiting me there, and turning
    to Andy I said, “Dear brother Andy, you must stay here among the dervishes
    and under the protection of the pious Murad-tseleb.
  </p>
  <p>This is my express order.</p>
  <p>Remember what I said to you last night.</p>
  <p>From now on your presence would be more trouble to me than it’s worth.</p>
  <p>
    ” Only such cold words as these could have kept him away from me and from
    danger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crimson in the face he replied, “You could have taken leave of me in a
    kindlier way than that.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you were always headstrong, and I have always forgiven you your
    harshness.
  </p>
  <p>Go in peace, then, before I start to howl.</p>
  <p>
    ” When I came home, the janissaries still in attendance, it was not yet
    midday.
  </p>
  <p>The house was empty and silent and the slaves had fled.</p>
  <p>
    Only the Indian who tended the fish sat cross legged by the pool, seemingly
    plunged in meditation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I walked quietly upstairs and to my astonishment found Mirmah busily engaged
    in pouring ink over page after page of my halffinished translation of the
    Koran.
  </p>
  <p>
    My most precious books she had torn in pieces so that the floor was white
    with their leaves.
  </p>
  <p>
    She started when she saw me, then put her hands behind her and stared at me
    in defiance.
  </p>
  <p>I had never struck her, and perhaps she thought I would not do so now.</p>
  <p>I asked, “Why have you done this, Mirmah?</p>
  <p>I don’t think I ever did you any harm.</p>
  <p>” She stared at me with a strange leer.</p>
  <p>
    Then, unable to contain herself any longer, she screamed with laughter and
    cried, “Down on the landing stage you’ll find a present that someone has
    thrown to you.
  </p>
  <p>That’s why everyone has run away.</p>
  <p>Go down and look.</p>
  <p>
    ” Full of forebodings I hurried down to the quay with the delighted Mirmah
    at my heels.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the janissaries had already found the body and the onbash was just
    turning the head with his foot to see the face.
  </p>
  <p>
    The body was naked, and so completely covered with blood that I thought at
    first the flayed carcass of an animal lay before me on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    The face was hard to recognize, as ears and nose had been cut away, the eyes
    put out, and the tongue gone from the gaping mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had seen much in my life but never so gruesome and appalling a sight as
    this.
  </p>
  <p>I have no wish to describe all that had been done to the body.</p>
  <p>
    It would serve no purpose but to chase sleep from my eyes, though some years
    have passed since it happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless I summoned up all my resolution and bent down, and bit by bit I
    seemed to recognize familiar lines in that mutilated face.
  </p>
  <p>
    I noted the henna color of those soft hands and their well-cared-for,
    polished nails.
  </p>
  <p>
    My heart stood still and the blood turned to ice in my veins, for I saw that
    this was Mustafa ben-Nakir returned from his visit to the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eunuchs of the harem had thrown him on to my landing stage, having dealt
    with him as with all who are caught in the forbidden rooms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mirmah bent down, stuck her finger in Mustafa ben-Nakir’s mouth and felt his
    pearly teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
    I snatched her up, thrust her into the arms of the onbash, and ordered him
    to take her out of my sight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mirmah shrieked, scratched, and kicked, but the men took her away by force
    and locked her into Giulia’s room.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a time she screamed and kicked at the door and smashed her mother’s
    valuable ornaments to pieces; then I think she fell asleep on Giulia’s bed,
    for presently we heard no more.
  </p>
  <p>
    I left the janissaries to bury the ravaged body of my friend Mustafa
    ben-Nakir, rewarding them with the last gold pieces in my purse.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sight had filled me with such nausea that I could not stay to help them,
    but was compelled to go in and lie upon my bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    After lying there for some hours and staring motionless at the ceiling I
    broke the fast of Ramadan, drank a cup of wine, and tried to eat, but found
    I could not swallow a mouthful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon I saw a magnificently ornamented boat gliding in toward the shore, and
    feeling strengthened by the wine I went down to receive my guests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The grateful janissaries had scrubbed the marble clean of all the blood.
  </p>
  <p>
    I fancy Mustafa ben- Nakir had been alive when he was thrown there and had
    bled copiously before he died.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now all was clean and neat and fit to receive the Seraglio barge with
    its silken awning.
  </p>
  <p>
    So incurably vain is human nature that I could not help feeling flattered as
    I beheld, besides the three red-clad deaf-mutes, the Kislar-Aga himself
    comfortably reclining in the stern.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mark of honor was enough to make me feel a man of consequence in the
    Ottoman Empire.
  </p>
  <p>
    With him was Giulia and her inseparable Alberto, but without so much as a
    glance at them I bowed low before the Kislar-Aga and touched brow and ground
    with my finger tips.
  </p>
  <p>Then I helped my distinguished guest from the boat.</p>
  <p>The deaf-mutes followed him on noiseless feet.</p>
  <p>
    When all were ashore I made a becoming speech of welcome and acknowledgment
    of the high honor he did me in coming to supervise the execution of the
    Sultan’s commands, and regretted that because of Ramadan I could not offer
    him so much as a cup of water.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his gracious reply he begged me to bear him no malice for the melancholy
    task with which he had been entrusted, and to express any wishes I might
    have before this task was carried out.
  </p>
  <p>
    I replied that I would gladly speak with my wife in private on certain
    household affairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this he assented, and when I had quietly placed a bowl of sherbet and a
    dish of sweetmeats beside him— leaving it to him and Allah between them to
    determine his attitude to the fast—I walked upstairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giulia followed me hesitantly, and close behind her as a shadow came the
    yellow-clad Alberto, who narrowly watched my every movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having assured herself that Mirmah was safely sleeping she turned to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inquisitive even at the last I asked her, “Has anything unusual happened at
    the Seraglio?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” “The Sultan woke late,” she answered absently, “and after very many
    prayers he commanded that all gold and silver plate be taken to the treasury
    and turned into minted coin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Henceforth he means to eat from platters of copper and drink from
    earthenware mugs.
  </p>
  <p>The whole city is to live by the law of the Koran, he says.</p>
  <p>
    All the afternoon he has been studying Sinan the Builder’s plans for the
    greatest mosque ever designed.
  </p>
  <p>It is to have ten minarets and the Sultan will build his tomb there.</p>
  <p>
    ” She paused and looked at me with those eyes of different colors; then with
    an air of innocence she asked, “Have you not seen your friend Mustafa
    ben-Nakir?
  </p>
  <p>He could tell you more than I can of the secrets of the Seraglio.</p>
  <p>” “So that was why they tore his tongue out,” I said coolly.</p>
  <p>“You may be easy about him, Giulia.</p>
  <p>He is at rest in his grave.</p>
  <p>Have you no more news?</p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia, enraged at my seeming indifference, sneered, “Are you so
    inquisitive?
  </p>
  <p>Well, it was to tell you everything that I returned.</p>
  <p>
    It may amuse you to know that your friend Mustafa ben-Nakir revealed
    Ibrahim’s plans to murder the Sultan and seize power by bribing the
    janissaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suleiman no longer dared be alone with his dear friend; the mutes stood
    hidden behind the curtain while Sultana Khurrem and I watched through a
    hidden opening in the wall.
  </p>
  <p>They had little to say to one another, those two old friends.</p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier played his violin with unusual fire, and immediately after
    the meal the Sultan y took a strong sleeping draught.
  </p>
  <p>
    No sooner was he asleep than Sultana Khurrem began taunting Ibrahim from
    behind the lattice and telling him of what Mustafa ben-Nakir had done.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier flew into a passion and told her his innermost thoughts
    about her.
  </p>
  <p>To put an end to this she beckoned the mutes to do their work.</p>
  <p>
    But he was so strong that contrary to custom the mutes had to inflict many
    deep wounds before they could master him enough to get the noose about his
    neck.
  </p>
  <p>We both saw how the blood splashed the walls of the room.</p>
  <p>The Sultan was carried elsewhere to have his sleep out undisturbed.</p>
  <p>
    Sultana Khurrem took the square seal from Ibrahim’s neck and had his body
    carried out to the Gateway of Peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the door of that bloody room was sealed at Khurrem’s orders by the
    Sultan’s seal, to remain forever a reminder of what can happen to an
    overambitious man.
  </p>
  <p>” “And Mustafa ben-Nakir?</p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia’s face flushed deeply; she quivered almost voluptuously and pressed
    against Alberto as she replied, “Sultana Khurrem is capricious and becomes
    much excited by the sight of blood.
  </p>
  <p>
    I may not speak of all that happened, but I fancy that Mustafa was not
    entirely disappointed.
  </p>
  <p>
    He remained long alone with her, but in the morning when a black thread
    could once more be distinguished from a white she sent him away lest he
    compromise her good name.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the trusty eunuchs found him in the forbidden garden and castrated him
    at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    They did a great deal more to him by means of short, keen knives, as is
    customary in the harem, and I believe that not even at Ibrahim’s death did
    Sultana Khurrem laugh so cooing a laugh as when she witnessed Mustafa’s
    fate.
  </p>
  <p>
    He heard it and raised his face to look upon her once more before they put
    out his eyes.
  </p>
  <p>” “I know, I know.</p>
  <p>You need say no more of that.</p>
  <p>But dusk is falling and it is time to tell me of yourself, dear Giulia.</p>
  <p>
    Tell me what sort of woman you are and why I have never pleased you—why it
    is you bear me so bitter a hatred.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia’s voice sank to a whisper and her whole body shook as she replied,
    “Last night I learned something new, Michael, though I thought I knew it
    all.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is for that alone that I’ve returned, for I know now—though you can never
    understand—what exquisite pleasure I shall find in watching the silken noose
    drawn tight about your throat.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you will do me one last service and struggle hard against the mutes,
    weakling though you are.
  </p>
  <p>
    If sleep is death’s brother, then for a chosen few voluptuous pleasure is
    its twin!
  </p>
  <p>
    This the Sultana has taught me, and my only regret is that I did not know it
    sooner; though at times when Alberto thrashed me I seemed to guess at
    something of the kind.
  </p>
  <p>” “What do I care about Alberto?</p>
  <p>
    I have long known that Mirmah is not my daughter, though I never cared to
    think of that too often.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also y g g I loved you very dearly, desperately though I fought against my
    love when once I knew what you were.
  </p>
  <p>Answer me one question.</p>
  <p>Have you ever, even for a short time, truly loved me?</p>
  <p>That is all I want to hear from you now, Giulia—only that.</p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia hesitated and turned a frightened glance toward Alberto’s
    expressionless face.
  </p>
  <p>Then she said quickly, “No, I have never really loved you—never.</p>
  <p>At least not after I found the man who could master me.</p>
  <p>
    This you never understood, though often I angered you to make you behave
    like a man and beat me.
  </p>
  <p>Ah, Michael, as a husband you’ve been worse than a eunuch.</p>
  <p>” She was now such a stranger to me that I did not even hate her.</p>
  <p>
    This strangeness terrified me more than all else, and I could not conceive
    how I had ever kissed her limbs and her false lips, and with tears.
  </p>
  <p>
    At last in a tremulous voice I said, “The sun is setting and soon the stars
    will come out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forgive me then, Giulia, for having spoiled your life and wearied you so
    long.
  </p>
  <p>
    No doubt it is partly my fault that during our life together you have been
    turned into a witch—a wild beast incapable of mercy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my madness I fancied that deep love meant warmth and kindness between two
    people, and some mutual solace in the hideous loneliness that is the lot of
    each one of us.
  </p>
  <p>I don’t blame you, Giulia.</p>
  <p>The mistake was mine and I blame only myself.</p>
  <p>” Giulia stared at me without grasping a word of what I was saying.</p>
  <p>I might have been speaking an unknown language.</p>
  <p>
    As I had no wish to delight her by displaying my terror of death, I
    straightened my trembling body and with head erect descended the stairs
    without giving her a glance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe I never even stammered as in the name of the Merciful and
    Compassionate I begged the Kislar-Aga respectfully to be prompt in the
    execution of his task.
  </p>
  <p>
    He started from his pleasant snooze, regarded me benignly, and clapped his
    fat hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    The three mutes at once entered the room, the first of them bearing beneath
    his arm a bundle that I supposed to contain the necessary black kaftan.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not but feel some curiosity as to the color of the silken noose.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the green I could not dare to hope, but even the red would have been a
    mark of high favor, for the salary I received entitled me to no more than
    the modest yellow cord.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when the mute unfolded the bundle I was surprised to see only a large
    leather sack which he spread out upon the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    At a sign from the Kislar-Aga he took out a hempen rope and while the other
    two seized Alberto firmly by the arms, he slipped the loop over die slave’s
    head from behind and strangled him so swiftly and deftly that he had no time
    to realize what was happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alberto had fallen lifeless with a swollen and distorted face before Giulia
    had taken it in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then she sprang on the kneeling eunuch like a cat, but his comrades knew
    their business.
  </p>
  <p>They caught her arms and y g twisted them behind her, holding her fast.</p>
  <p>
    She kicked, howled, and tossed her head from side to side, her eyes
    bloodshot with fury.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kislar-Aga surveyed her with his head on one side, as if deriving
    pleasure from her anguish.
  </p>
  <p>To me he said courteously, “Forgive me, slave Michael.</p>
  <p>
    By command of my sovereign lady I am to see that your wife is strangled,
    after which she will be sewn into a leather sack and thrown into the
    Marmara.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sultana Khurrem is as you know a devout lady and abominates the indecencies
    of which your wife Giulia has so repeatedly been guilty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only recently did she learn how criminally Giulia abused her confidence by
    disguising her lover as a eunuch so as to take him with her into the
    forbidden apartments of the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally you are guiltless of this and I share your deep sorrow, but so
    shameful an offense must be punished and I can assure you that in future the
    noble Sultana Khurrem will be more discriminating in her choice of company.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia had ceased her outcry and was now listening incredulously to his
    quiet speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    Froth appeared at the corners of her mouth as she screamed, “Are you out of
    your mind, Kislar-Aga?
  </p>
  <p>You shall pay for this with your head.</p>
  <p>
    I know too much about you and your secret dealings with the Seraglio
    physicians.
  </p>
  <p>” “Quite so,” said the Kislar-Aga, and his fat, pale face was stony.</p>
  <p>“You know too much, you foolish woman.</p>
  <p>
    It is for that reason that Sultana Khurrem has resolved to render you
    harmless.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should have understood that long ago—you should have seen it in the
    sand!
  </p>
  <p>” With that he had had enough of words.</p>
  <p>
    Once more he gave a sign, the noose was slipped about Giulia’s throat and
    drawn tight, so that her wild shriek was cut short.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trembling all over I turned away my head, unwilling to see those eyes fade
    in death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her body was then lashed to Alberto’s and both were pushed into the sack,
    which was quickly sewn up.
  </p>
  <p>
    When at last the mutes had departed with their burden I said in
    astonishment, “How dare they leave us alone together?
  </p>
  <p>
    I might have a weapon upon me and in my terror of death do you an injury.
  </p>
  <p>
    And why put off the inevitable any longer, for I suppose that my fate at
    your hands was preordained before my birth, noble Kislar- Aga.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He stroked his bulging chin and his eyes were cold as steel as he replied,
    “I have executed the Sultana’s orders as confirmed by the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also were to have been strangled, but here matters took an unexpected
    turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultan, noble man, greatly admires loyalty and daring, though he does
    not care to speak his mind to the Sultana.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps too he stands just now in special need of acquiring merit.</p>
  <p>
    Therefore he commanded me secretly, without Sultana Khurrem’s knowledge, to
    spare you, because you risked your life to g p y y y give Grand Vizier
    Ibrahim an honorable burial.
  </p>
  <p>
    The city was in so disturbed a state that you might have been torn in pieces
    for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I may tell you in confidence that your action has greatly healed and solaced
    his heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, as you will understand, he is compelled to banish you from the city,
    that the Sultana may never learn of your reprieve.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is once more a prey to profound melancholy and needs the consolation of
    white arms and a soft embrace.
  </p>
  <p>But you have placed me in a grave dilemma, Michael el-Hakim.</p>
  <p>
    I am bound to obey the Sultan’s express command, yet I greatly fear the
    wrath of Sultana Khurrem.
  </p>
  <p>Whither will you go, Michael?</p>
  <p>” “What do you say to Egypt, noble Kislar-Aga?</p>
  <p>” I asked meekly.</p>
  <p>
    “I fancy that that land is far enough away, and I believe I could find
    refuge there if you allow it.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” While I was speaking there entered on noiseless feet a little eunuch who
    was also a mute; he closely scrutinized my appearance and with a gesture
    invited me to be seated.
  </p>
  <p>
    He then began to shave me, and afterward set out many materials and pots of
    color.
  </p>
  <p>“Egypt will do very well,” the Kislar-Aga assented.</p>
  <p>“You must forget your former life and assume a new name.</p>
  <p>You must also alter your appearance.</p>
  <p>My barber is now shaving you and will next dye your skin brown.</p>
  <p>
    Don’t be afraid at the wrinkles that will appear on your face as a
    result—they will disappear in a few weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tomorrow the Sultan is to proclaim the dissolution of the brotherhood of
    whom Ibrahim was grand master.
  </p>
  <p>
    Countless dervishes will be fleeing for fear of the Mufti, and if you
    disguise yourself as one of them you need not fear detection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember only to talk as little as possible— and try in every way to behave
    yourself, or Sultana Khurrem will never forgive me.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The queer tone in which he said this made me suddenly suspicious, and I
    leaned forward to look more closely at the inscrutable face of a man trained
    in the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>“Noble Kislar-Aga!</p>
  <p>
    Only the mutes have seen us and the Sultan need know nothing of what
    happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    How comes it that you’re willing to spare me, when in general I know you to
    be a shrewd man?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” “I am a Moslem,” he replied piously, “and the Sultan is Allah’s shadow on
    earth.
  </p>
  <p>It is he alone whom I must obey, though it should cost me my head.</p>
  <p>
    ” He stroked his fat chin, coughed, and added casually, “Of course I expect
    a present worthy of you, and I fancy I shall not be disappointed.
  </p>
  <p>
    No doubt you will allow me to glance into the sack that you’ll be taking
    with you to Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>” “Alas, what are you saying?</p>
  <p>Through my wife’s extravagance I’m a poor man, as you must know.</p>
  <p>I own nothing but my house and furniture, and these I freely give you.</p>
  <p>” He shook his head reproachfully.</p>
  <p>“Remember you are dead.</p>
  <p>
    Your wife also is dead, therefore your fair daughter Mirmah is your only
    lawful heir.
  </p>
  <p>
    How can you be so base as to seek to deceive the man who has saved your
    life?
  </p>
  <p>” “Mirmah!</p>
  <p>” I cried with a start.</p>
  <p>“What is to become of her?</p>
  <p>
    ” The Kislar-Aga, resentful of my ingratitude, nevertheless answered
    patiently, “Sultana Khurrem is a pious woman and out of compassion for your
    unprotected daughter will take her into the harem and give her a suitable
    upbringing.
  </p>
  <p>She will also take over the stewardship of her property.</p>
  <p>
    The Defterdar’s clerk will shortly appear here to make an inventory and to
    seal the house with the Sultana’s personal seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be well for you to make haste and bring out your treasure chest, or
    I may be tempted to follow your good advice.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I found myself in very great perplexity, for I knew that if I showed him
    Muley-Hassan’s diamonds I should never see a sign of them again, and he
    would certainly not allow me to dig up the bag alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we were conversing the little barber had completely altered my
    appearance and now stood admiring the results of his work.
  </p>
  <p>
    He gave me a set of ragged garments, such as dervishes wear, and an
    evil-smelling goatskin to throw over my shoulders.
  </p>
  <p>He had even provided me with an old staff.</p>
  <p>
    I could not recognize myself when I looked at my reflection in the mirror.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was still anxiously debating with myself how to satisfy the rapacious
    Kislar-Aga when my own deaf-mute entered the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    With flickering fingers he begged my pardon for entering unsummoned, then
    signed to me to accompany him to the cellars.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kislar-Aga would not let me out of his sight for an instant, so we took
    a lantern and went down together.
  </p>
  <p>
    I seldom went to the cellar save to fetch up a jar of wine, and the
    deaf-mute led us to a room whose existence I had never suspected, since
    Giulia alone had instructed Sinan how the house was to be built.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clothes belonging to Alberto lay scattered about, and there was also a
    richly covered bed where Giulia must often have been when I fancied her at
    the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remains of food, already moldy, a jar of wine, and a lithe cane showed how
    diligently they had refreshed and revived themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The deaf-mute raised one of the flagstones and from the hole thus exposed
    came the blaze of gold and precious stones.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kislar-Aga, forgetful of his dignity, fell on his knees and buried his
    arms to the elbows in coin, then brought out some magnificent ornaments that
    he inspected with the air of a connoisseur.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only now did I understand what had become of my wealth during all these
    years.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Michael el-Hakim,” said the Kislar-Aga, “your slave is more intelligent
    than you and deserves recompense.
  </p>
  <p>
    He will be raised to a position undreamed-of for one of his quality, for the
    mutes have chosen him to be their seventh man, now that his predecessor has
    p disgraced himself by the wounds he inflicted on the Grand Vizier.
  </p>
  <p>
    They have already taught him how to handle the noose and he will soon be
    entirely competent for his merciful function.
  </p>
  <p>It was no doubt to win my favor that he showed us this hidden treasure.</p>
  <p>
    ” He glanced with benevolent condescension at the deaf-mute and even patted
    him on the back.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the slave fell upon his knees to me, kissed my feet, watered my hands
    with his tears, and looked at me with so intelligent and human an expression
    that with a flash of insight I realized that he knew more about me than I
    had ever suspected.
  </p>
  <p>
    My repugnance melted away and with my finger tips I touched his brow, eyes,
    and cheeks as a sign that I understood him.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time I felt greatly relieved not to be burdened with him on my
    journey to Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kislar-Aga grew impatient and said, “Michael, you know me for an honest
    man.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take ten gold pieces from this heap; that’s a great sum for a poor dervish.
  </p>
  <p>You may also give a gold piece to your slave.</p>
  <p>
    ” Without further delay he took off his costly kaftan and spread it upon the
    ground, then with both hands heaped gold and jewels upon it.
  </p>
  <p>
    He had just tied sleeves and hem together to make a bundle when there was a
    fearful explosion.
  </p>
  <p>The floor shook, and plaster poured from the ceiling.</p>
  <p>
    The portly Kislar-Aga shook like a jelly and cried, “Allah means to punish
    the city!
  </p>
  <p>This is an earthquake.</p>
  <p>
    Let us hurry out before we’re trapped like rats beneath the tumbling walls.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I too was frightened, but as I listened I could distinguish thunderous
    shots and understood that a cannon ball had struck the house.
  </p>
  <p>
    The janissaries in the garden were yelling at the tops of their voices and
    guessing at once what had happened I cursed Andy from the bottom of my heart
    because he would not even let me die in peace, but at the last moment must
    come meddling in my affairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ran swiftly upstairs and out into the garden, to see flames bursting from
    the janissaries’ muskets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The din of the shooting deafened me, and it was then that I became aware of
    a dozen wine- and opiummaddened dervishes howling and whirling and
    brandishing scimitars all over my flowerbeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    I roared to Andy to call off this nonsense, the Kislar-Aga standing behind
    me meanwhile, trembling and holding me convulsively by the sleeves.
  </p>
  <p>Like most eunuchs he was afraid of noise and shooting.</p>
  <p>
    Andy obeyed and staggered forward, yet his eyes passed me by and he said
    inquiringly, “The voice is Jacob’s, but where is Esau’s hairy breast?
  </p>
  <p>
    I seemed to hear my brother Michael’s bleating voice, though I came only to
    take charge of his corpse.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The Kislar-Aga, much to the onbash’s relief, dismissed the janissaries,
    who had not dared fire directly on the holy men.
  </p>
  <p>
    These now whirled about the garden in their wild dances, calling on the name
    of Allah, reciting verses from the Koran, and gashing one g g g another with
    their swords until their blood ran down in streams.
  </p>
  <p>
    To my delight not even the onbash had recognized me after my treatment at
    the barber’s hands.
  </p>
  <p>It was long before I could persuade Andy of my identity, but at last?</p>
  <p>
    we attended the Kislar-Aga to his boat with all honor, and even helped him
    with his bundle, which was too heavy for a man of his years to carry alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, when Andy and I were by ourselves, we dug up our buried diamonds, left
    the dervishes to their sacred dances, and slipped away in silence and
    without regret.
  </p>
  <p>
    That same night a fishing boat took us across the straits to Scutari, whence
    we were to embark upon our long voyage.
  </p>
  <p>
    These nine books of my life I have written in the course of two years, at
    the dervish monastery near Cairo.
  </p>
  <p>
    For when after innumerable difficulties and sufferings I stood at last
    before Suleiman the eunuch he would not believe my story.
  </p>
  <p>He robbed me of my diamonds and locked me up in this cloister.</p>
  <p>
    The purpose of these books has been to prove to the noble Suleiman that
    after Grand Vizier Ibrahim’s death I did not steal his diamonds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ill-natured persons have even declared that I arranged his funeral solely in
    order to come at the treasure he had amassed in the course of years, since
    as his confidential friend I alone knew of their secret hiding place in the
    palace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet it is not my fault if the incompetent Defterdar’s clerks have not been
    able to find that hiding place, and if they fancy I had time to conceal the
    treasure before the mutes strangled me in my house.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote these nine books also to bring peace to my heart and to free myself
    from the oppressive memories of my former existence, for only thus can I
    begin a new life, having now—at least in my own eyes—matured as a human
    being.
  </p>
  <p>
    To attain this I have had to undergo many hard trials, of which my wife
    Giulia with her strange eyes was by no means the least.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now I believe I have found the right path, and I believe also that I am
    able to lead the life of an ordinary man, if only I may be given the
    opportunity to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    Openly and finally I mean to abstain from good resolutions, having found
    that where others are concerned they are apt to do more harm than good.
  </p>
  <p>OceanofPDF.</p>
  <p>
    com Epilogue THE Nile had twice overflowed its banks before the unhappy
    dervish Michael reached the end of his long story.
  </p>
  <p>
    He wrote at night, and each morning presented himself at Suleiman the
    eunuch’s palace to read aloud to him what he had written.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when at last he made an end, the thin and ragged dervish prostrated
    himself before Suleiman shedding bitter tears, and raising his hands in
    supplication he said, “Hear my prayer, noble Suleiman!
  </p>
  <p>
    Release me from these intolerable devotional exercises of the dervishes and
    above all restore to me my lawful property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this long story of mine I have shown conclusively that I came by it
    in what amounts to an honest manner, and now need it to begin the life of an
    ordinary man.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be foolish indeed to start again as a beggar, and I would rather
    submit to the grim necessity of remaining for the rest of my days in this
    monastery.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Suleiman the eunuch stroked his many chins and his eyes were like slits as
    he surveyed the weeping dervish.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then a smile overspread his moonlike face, as he said, “Ah, Michael
    el-Hakim!
  </p>
  <p>Strange indeed are the shapes into which Allah molds his clay!</p>

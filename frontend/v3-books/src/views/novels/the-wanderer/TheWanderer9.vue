  <p>
    On receiving Ibrahim’s letter the Sultan hesitated no longer; indeed, I
    believe he was overjoyed that for once his beloved Khurrem and Ibrahim were
    agreed, and he lost no time in calling the Divan.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this assembly he presented Khaireddin with a sword whose hilt and
    scabbard sparkled with countless diamonds, and he conferred upon him the
    Vizier’s standard of three horsehair switches and the title of Kapudan-pasha
    of the navy, with unlimited powers at sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    This represented something very different from the authority vested in
    senior Venetian officers, for example.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eyes of the Signoria were ever upon these men and their powers were
    limited by the sealed orders issued to them beforehand to cover different
    situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Sultan nominated Khaireddin independent governor of all his ports
    and islands, with supreme command of all vessels and their captains.
  </p>
  <p>
    In naval matters he was subordinate to none but the Sultan, and at meetings
    of the Divan he took his place beside the Sultan’s viziers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus the erstwhile potter was elevated at a stroke to rank with the four or
    five most eminent men in the Ottoman Empire.
  </p>
  <p>
    In acknowledgment of these unprecedented honors, Khaireddin delivered a
    voluble and bombastic address in a voice with which he was used to make
    himself heard above the roar of the elements, until some of the eunuchs cast
    anxious glances upward, fearing the collapse of the starry roof.
  </p>
  <p>
    He brought the speech to an end with the following words: “In short, I mean
    to inflict as much damage as I may g g y upon the unbelievers and carry the
    Crescent to honor and victory upon the seas.
  </p>
  <p>
    First I shall overwhelm, destroy, annihilate, and sink the idolater Doria,
    who is my personal enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let me conquer Tunis as I have so often besought you, and thereby gain an
    important base for the fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
    For centuries the caravan routes from the Negro lands beyond the desert have
    converged upon this city, and I shall be able to send you and your harem an
    abundance of gold dust and ostrich feathers.
  </p>
  <p>But dominion of the seas is naturally my chief aim.</p>
  <p>
    And believe me, O Commander of the Faithful, he who rules the sea soon comes
    to rule the lands about that sea!
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I have quoted this much of his address to show how irresponsible,
    childish, and rash was Khaireddin’s conduct in the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little did he know of the ways of the Divan when he thus trumpeted abroad
    his private schemes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A whisper in the Divan quickly arrived at every court in Europe, and no
    earthly power could prevent it even when, according to ancient Ottoman
    tradition, the Divan was held on horseback to discuss questions of peace and
    war.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet strange as it may seem, once at sea Khaireddin outdid all his rivals in
    cunning, and because of his notorious guile the Imperial envoys would not
    believe that his main objective was indeed Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>They laughed at him up their sleeves for fancying he could delude them.</p>
  <p>The Knights of St.</p>
  <p>
    John were convinced that he intended the capture of Malta, while others
    believed that Rome itself or Cartagena was in his mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet however ludicrous Khaireddin’s behavior in the Divan, it must be
    stressed that in seafaring matters he had no equal.
  </p>
  <p>
    No sooner had the horsetail switches been bestowed than he rolled up the
    sleeves of his kaftan of honor and started a great turnout of the arsenal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many useless heads ended under the archway of the Gate of Peace, and to
    replace various Seraglio-trained striplings in silken kaftans Khaireddin
    appointed seasoned renegades.
  </p>
  <p>
    He laid down the keels of new war galleys and reorganized the distribution
    of sea pashas among the islands and along the coasts, so as to bring back
    capable men to arsenal and ships.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spring cleaning of the arsenal stirred up the same conflicts that had
    cost Andy his plume, though this time the roles were reversed.
  </p>
  <p>Having now encountered the terrifying carrack of the Knights of St.</p>
  <p>
    John, the old sea pashas at last showed an inclination to move with the
    times and demanded larger craft to carry heavier armaments.
  </p>
  <p>
    But although Khaireddin fully appreciated the firing powers of these great
    Christian vessels, yet he considered them too slow in maneuvering and, as an
    experienced pirate, attached far more importance to speed and mobility than
    to size.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was now Khaireddin’s business, through my mediation, to be reconciled
    with Chief Pilot Piri-reis, whom he had so deeply p y wounded by his
    contemptuous behavior, for notwithstanding his sneers he had the greatest
    respect for the famous book of charts and valued the old man’s advice more
    than he would admit.
  </p>
  <p>
    They debated long together as to the respective merits of large and small
    vessels, but whereas Piri- reis spoke in favor of the former, Khaireddin
    remained unconvinced and preferred to act upon his own experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the spring rains the Grand Vizier began the march from Aleppo to
    Persia at the head of his magnificent army, and at once the Sultan was
    seized with a great restlessness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fresh winds were blowing, and the stuffy air of the Seraglio so irked him
    that despite all tenderly whispered dissuasion he was minded to set out in
    time to lead the forthcoming campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile Khaireddin hoisted sail and the greatest and bestappointed fleet
    ever seen off Istanbul stood out to sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    Andy sailed with him in the flagship as master gunner, Abu el-Kasim embarked
    also, while I remained behind to spread helpful rumors as to Khaireddin’s
    real intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I succeeded best with the story that he was bound for Genoa, to recapture
    that city on behalf of the French King, for everyone knew what a triumph it
    would be for him to swoop on Doria’s very aerie.
  </p>
  <p>
    This attempt of mine to keep Doria within the shelter of his city succeeded
    beyond all hope, and I was thus of far greater service to Khaireddin than if
    I had gone to sea with him as his adviser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultan had much to attend to before setting forth to war, including the
    imprisonment of Rashid ben-Hafs, Prince of Tunis, which was so secretly
    effected that Khaireddin’s own officers believed the Prince had sailed with
    them and was merely staying below decks because of the rolling seas.
  </p>
  <p>
    But undoubtedly the most important step taken by Suleiman was the
    appointment of Prince Mustafa as Governor of Anatolia.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Prince was now fifteen years old and had ruled as sanjak over a
    district; this new appointment finally confirmed the Sultan’s choice of
    Mustafa as his lawful heir, though many had been led by Sultana Khurrem’s
    ever increasing influence to doubt this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pious Moslems, dazzled by the incomparable splendor of their military and
    naval forces, were persuaded that the great age of Islam had dawned.
  </p>
  <p>Only Sultana Khurrem was silent.</p>
  <p>
    One day toward the end of summer, I was crossing the janissaries’ deserted
    courtyard, with my perfumed handkerchief to my nose because of the stench of
    severed heads from the vaults of the Gateway of Peace, when a limping onbash
    came up to me, struck me roughly on the shoulder with his cane, and having
    made sure of my name announced that he had orders to arrest me—to throw me
    in chains and confine me in the Fort of the Seven Towers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I shouted aloud for help and insisted that there must be some terrible
    mistake, since I had nothing to hide and all my actions could bear the light
    of day.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the onbash silenced me with a blow across the mouth, and before I was
    fully aware of what was happening he had taken me to the smith, who riveted
    shackles about my ankles and held out a sooty hand—I must reward him for
    neither burning me nor breaking my bones.
  </p>
  <p>
    A sack was drawn over my head lest any in the street should recognize me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was lifted onto a donkey and led the long way from the Seraglio to the
    Fort of the Seven Towers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The constable, a thin-lipped eunuch, received me in person, for my rank and
    position were well known.
  </p>
  <p>
    He made me undress, searched and removed my clothes, giving me a worn camlet
    kaftan, and asked me politely whether I would have a cook of my own or be
    content with prison fare, which would cost me only two aspers a day.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sudden stunning blow of fate had so clouded my understanding that in a
    faint voice I declared myself satisfied to eat the same food as other
    prisoners.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was resolved to mortify my flesh and pass my time in pious meditation
    after my life of luxury in the Sultan’s service.
  </p>
  <p>
    I bade the eunuch take from my purse a sum befitting his rank and dignity,
    and hoped that in return he would inform my unfortunate wife as to where I
    was and what had happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    But he shook his head and told me that this was out of the question, since
    all state prisoners must be kept as completely cut off from the outer world
    as if they dwelt in the moon.
  </p>
  <p>
    This eunuch showed me the greatest consideration and respect, and even
    exerted himself to climb with me up the steep stairs to show me the view
    from the marble pinnacles of the Golden Gate.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time I had the opportunity of observing the measures taken to
    defend the fort against assailants, and I believe that the walls alone that
    linked one tower with the next were enough to sever us from the outer world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the square marble tower of the Golden Gate he showed me bricked-up,
    windowless vaults into which food was passed through an opening the width of
    a hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    These were designed for the highest princes of Osman’s line and for viziers
    and members of the Divan, whose rank did not permit them to be shackled.
  </p>
  <p>
    With pardonable pride he pointed to one wall and told me that not even the
    oldest warder knew who lived behind it, and the prisoner himself could not
    tell him, as his tongue had been cut out on his arrest many, many years ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    He then showed me the deep hole through which corpses were thrown into the
    moat and thence carried away into the Marmara.
  </p>
  <p>
    For my further entertainment he pointed out the bloodstained block where
    executions by the sword took place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above a long-since bricked- up gateway a faded gold inscription in Greek
    letters could still be seen, surmounted by the two-headed eagle of y g the
    Byzantine emperors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of this only the heads had been hewn away, to spare the feelings of pious
    Moslems.
  </p>
  <p>
    At length, with many apologies, he showed me my own accommodation—a roomy
    stone cell with windows looking out over the courtyard.
  </p>
  <p>
    I might wander freely about this court and eat if I chose beside the wooden
    cookhouse.
  </p>
  <p>
    He left me to my misery, and for three days and nights I lay on the hard
    wooden bench in my cell, without appetite or desire for company.
  </p>
  <p>
    Desperately I puzzled over the reason for my arrest, and indeed wondered
    that anyone had dared to order it, since to judge from Ibrahim’s letters I
    still enjoyed his favor.
  </p>
  <p>
    I passed all my actions in review, and even my secret thoughts, but without
    finding anything to justify my plight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the more earnestly a man broods over possible guilt, the guiltier he
    feels.
  </p>
  <p>
    After three days and nights of selfexamination I was so keenly aware that at
    least in my heart I had broken many laws, both of the Prophet and of man,
    that I was left like a guttering candle, and felt of all outcasts the most
    wretched.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the third day the duty onbash came to me with a bundle of clothes, my old
    copper pen case, and a letter from Giulia.
  </p>
  <p>
    She hinted obscurely that I had only myself and my ingratitude to thank for
    my hard fate.
  </p>
  <p>“Never should I have thought that you would deceive me so,” she wrote.</p>
  <p>
    “If you had revealed your base scheme to me I could at least have warned
    you.
  </p>
  <p>
    And now, but for my tears and prayers, your head would have been cut off and
    your body thrown into the pit.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can do no more for you; you have made your bed and must lie on it,
    thankless Michael.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can never forgive your conduct, for soon I shall be forced to pawn my
    jewels to meet household expenses.
  </p>
  <p>” Her incomprehensible letter put me altogether beside myself.</p>
  <p>
    I rushed to the eunuch, burst into passionate reproaches, and ended, “I can
    bear this uncertainty no longer—I am going out of my mind.
  </p>
  <p>What am I accused of, that I may at least defend myself?</p>
  <p>
    When the Grand Vizier returns he will inflict terrible punishment on
    everyone who has dared to lay a hand on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have my irons struck off, my good man, and release me at once from this
    prison, or even you may lose your head.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The eunuch was annoyed at being disturbed in his exacting work of casting
    accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet as became a man trained in the Seraglio he kept his temper and answered
    pleasantly, “Ah, Michael el-Hakim, in five or ten years when you are a
    little more composed we will discuss the question again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Very few state prisoners know what they’re accused of, for the essence of
    the punishment decreed by the Sultan in his wisdom lies in that very torment
    of uncertainty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not one of our distinguished guests knows whether he will remain here a
    week, a year, or his whole life.
  </p>
  <p>
    At any hour of the day or night the deaf-mutes may come and lead you to the
    brink of the pit; at any y y p y hour the gates of the prison may open
    before you and release you once more into the world of men, to attain
    perhaps to even higher distinctions than before.
  </p>
  <p>
    You would be wise to devote this favorable time to mystic contemplation,
    until like the dervishes you come to understand that in the eyes of Allah
    all is illusion, whether it be imprisonment or freedom, wealth or poverty,
    power or serfdom.
  </p>
  <p>Therefore I shall be happy to lend you the Koran.</p>
  <p>
    ” But it was easier to discuss these things in the sweatroom of the
    bathhouse than behind the iron bars of a prison.
  </p>
  <p>
    I lost all control of myself and began to stamp and shriek until he was
    compelled to have me seized by janissaries and caned on the soles of my
    feet.
  </p>
  <p>
    My fury soon dissolved into tears of pain, and the janissaries held me under
    the arms and half-carried me back to my cell, where they touched brow and
    floor with their finger tips to convey their continued good will and
    respect.
  </p>
  <p>
    The swelling and agony of my feet distracted my thoughts, as the wise eunuch
    had intended, and so in time I composed myself and began to live each day as
    it came.
  </p>
  <p>
    My one hope was that when the Grand Vizier returned from Persia he would
    miss me and, Seraglio intrigues notwithstanding, discover my whereabouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The five daily prayers and ablutions helped to pass the time, and having
    nothing else to do I diligently studied the Koran.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also took the friendly eunuch’s advice and performed the breathing
    exercises of the dervishes, and fasted now and then.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I soon found my faith too weak for me to attain the state of supreme
    rapture extolled by Marabouts and holy dervishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    At last, therefore, I abandoned these exercises and was content to maintain
    my body in good health and to eat with appetite.
  </p>
  <p>
    All day long I strolled about the courtyard while flocks of migrating birds
    swept with a rush of wings overhead against the turquoise sky of autumn.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way I came to know my fellow captives, among whom were many eminent
    Mussulmans and also Christians who were of value to the Sultan for the
    exchange of prisoners.
  </p>
  <p>
    They idled the days away lying on the grass about the cookhouse, though some
    of the more industrious busied themselves with carving tallies of the days
    of their imprisonment, and proverbs, on the smooth stones at the base of the
    towers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Twice I met Rashid, the Prince of Tunis, and heard him revile Khaireddin and
    Sultan Suleiman for their dastardly betrayal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weeks passed, the acacias in the courtyard shed their leaves, the days grew
    chilly, and I wearied of the company of my fellows.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was consumed with yearning for my beautiful house on the shores of the
    Bosphorus, and could imagine nothing more desirable than to recline on a
    soft cushion on the terrace as dusk fell over the waters and one by one the
    stars came out.
  </p>
  <p>
    I longed to see again my red and y g g y gold fish, to hold my little
    daughter Mirmah by the hand and guide her steps as she struggled toward the
    faithful Alberto’s embrace.
  </p>
  <p>I wasted away with longing and believed myself abandoned by everyone.</p>
  <p>
    One clear autumn day as I stood on top of the marble tower I looked across
    the misty blue sea and beheld sails, pennants, and silver crescents, and
    like an echo from another world I heard the boom of cannon from Seraglio
    Point.
  </p>
  <p>
    The turrets of the Gateway of Peace shimmered dreamlike in the distance,
    while at my feet the billowing landscape, sprinkled with white tombstones,
    glowed golden in the clear autumn air.
  </p>
  <p>
    A dusty, chalk-white road wound its way among the hills and vanished in the
    distance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The freedom, the beauty of the scene cut me to the heart, and I was sorely
    tempted to hurl myself down from the giddy height of the tower and find
    release from this world’s vanity, suffering, and hope.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well that I did not, for that day brought an unexpected turn in my fortunes.
  </p>
  <p>At dusk three deaf-mutes came to the prison.</p>
  <p>
    With dragging steps they crossed the courtyard to the marble tower on the
    side nearest the sea, where the death pit was.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here in silence they strangled Prince Rashid and cast his lecherous body
    into the hole, from which incident I concluded that Khaireddin had captured
    Tunis and so had no further use for Rashid ben-Hafs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like all the other prisoners I was aghast at the arrival of these deaf-
    mutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of the three I recognized at once the ashen-faced, cruel Negro who used to
    visit Abu el-Kasim’s slave.
  </p>
  <p>
    As he crossed the courtyard he gave me an expressionless look, but with his
    fingers he made a reassuring sign to show that I was not altogether
    forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
    This greeting was the first message I had had from the outer world since
    Giulia’s letter, and I was seized by so feverish an agitation that I could
    not sleep that night.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the third day after the deaf-mutes’ appearance I was summoned by the
    eunuch, who ordered my fetters to be struck off, gave me back my clothes and
    money, and accompanied me to the gate as a mark of his unchanging regard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus I was released as suddenly and mysteriously as I had been imprisoned so
    many months ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside, to my amazement, I found Abu el-Kasim awaiting me in a splendid
    palanquin, and no one will blame me for bursting into tears at the sight of
    him.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wept like a fountain, leaning against his scrawny shoulder and breathing
    in the bitter, spicy smell of his kaftan as if he had been my father.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abu drew me in beside him and under cover of the curtains gave me a little
    wine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recovering slightly from my agitation I asked him eagerly whether I was
    indeed free, what I had been accused of and what had been happening in the
    world since I had been snatched pp g from it.
  </p>
  <p>Abu el-Kasim said, “Ask no foolish questions.</p>
  <p>
    The matter is of no importance and will become clear to you in due course.
  </p>
  <p>
    All you need do now is come home, recite the first sura, and give me the
    Russian woman and her son according to your promise.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was only to fetch them that I returned, and for the rest of my days I
    shall live peacefully in Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to Khaireddin that town has been liberated from the Hafsid tyranny
    and now celebrates its freedom under the vigilant protection of the
    janissaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Not until he had assured himself that I meant to keep my word and give him
    the Russian did he heave a sigh of relief and tell me the reason for my
    imprisonment.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seemed that when Khaireddin set sail in the spring he made first for
    Coron and supplied the fortress with new cannon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then for the first time in history the Mussulman fleet sailed openly through
    the Strait of Messina to display its strength, after which it cruised slowly
    northward and systematically raided the coast of the Kingdom of Naples.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doria dared not come out to meet Khaireddin, since because of seemingly
    well-founded rumors he believed the fleet to be bound for Genoa.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most unluckily a Christian slave, in return for his freedom, promised to
    show Khaireddin’s land forces the way to the castle of Fondi, where there
    was reputed to be immense treasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It appeared, however,” said Abu el-Kasim, “that the slave had greatly
    exaggerated the value of this, and in their fury the janissaries broke into
    the chapel, plundered the coffins of the dead lords of the castle, and
    scattered their bones.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lady of the castle, a widow of ripe years named Giulia Gonzaga, fled in
    her nightgown.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin had never heard of her, but after her escape she spread the most
    colorful stories of her flight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since her widowhood she had been wont to entertain poets and other riffraff,
    in the frivolous Italian manner, and in return for her hospitality these
    poets hailed her in their verses as the most beautiful woman in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>You know what poets are— there was no harm in any of it.</p>
  <p>
    But in her crazy vanity this woman spread the report that Khaireddin had
    stormed her castle solely on her account, because he meant to send her to
    the harem of his lord, Sultan Suleiman.
  </p>
  <p>She told the tale so often that she began to believe it herself.</p>
  <p>” “Allah be good to us!</p>
  <p>” I exclaimed, deeply shaken.</p>
  <p>“Now I understand.</p>
  <p>
    Small wonder that Sultana Khurrem was angry when she heard of this, for she
    must have believed that Khaireddin had betrayed her confidence at my
    instigation.
  </p>
  <p>I can only marvel that my head remains on my shoulders.</p>
  <p>A woman scorned is more savage in her jealousy than an Indian tiger.</p>
  <p>
    ” “The Venetian Signoria took care that this entertaining story should reach
    the ears of the Sultana, and she was the more eager to g believe it for a
    certain disharmony that had arisen between her and the Sultan over Prince
    Mustafa, just before Suleiman went to war.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best proof of its falsehood is that the groom who risked his life to
    save Giulia Gonzaga was slain afterward at her order, because he laughed at
    her story and said that the Sultan would certainly prefer a sack of flour to
    the lady’s somewhat flabby charms.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” “Then,” I remarked, “the misunderstanding must now have been cleared up
    and Sultana Khurrem will know that I am innocent.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if not, I must flee to Persia and seek refuge with the Grand Vizier,
    loath though I am to encounter Shiite swords.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Abu el-Kasim said, “She believes in your innocence, and Khaireddin’s
    princely gifts have entirely dispelled her groundless suspicions.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now Grand Vizier Ibrahim is reported to have marched with great pomp
    into Tabriz, the Shah’s capital, and so reached the peak of his glory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultan has joined him there and lovely Khurrem can only sit and bite her
    nails.
  </p>
  <p>
    For many days Istanbul has been rejoicing at the conquest of Persia, and now
    new fires are being lit to celebrate the capture of Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” We embarked in my boat, and as the stars came out and sparkled like silver
    sand against the blue of the night sky I saw far away my beautiful house and
    garden, and the high walls rising in terraces above the shore.
  </p>
  <p>
    So unreal did all things seem to me that life itself appeared but as a
    dream, a flower, a song.
  </p>
  <p>
    I drove my nails into the palms of my hands in an effort to control myself,
    impatient for the moment when I could once more hold my wife Giulia in my
    arms.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slaves had hardly raised their oars to let the boat glide noiselessly to
    the marble landing stage before I leaped out, and on winged feet sped up the
    steps to my house.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seizing the first lamp I saw I hastened to the upper floor, calling out
    Giulia’s name in the hope that she might yet be awake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hearing the noise, the faithful Alberto came rushing to meet me with his
    hair on end, breathless from astonishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    He hastened to fasten his yellow coat and threw himself at my feet weeping
    for joy at my return, and embracing my legs with his powerful arms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not until he heard Giulia calling to me in a faint voice did he come to his
    senses and release me.
  </p>
  <p>Giulia was lying limply on her bed, her hair curling over the pillow.</p>
  <p>“Oh, Michael, is that you?</p>
  <p>I thought by the noise that thieves had broken in.</p>
  <p>
    I can’t think how it is you’re here so soon, for Sultana Khurrem and I
    agreed that it should be tomorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Someone has been negligent or taken a bribe, and deserves severe punishment
    for the fright you’ve given me.
  </p>
  <p>My heart is still thumping and I can scarcely draw breath.</p>
  <p>
    ” She sounded indeed so breathless and frightened that I raised the lamp to
    look at her, and although she quickly drew up the coverlet and hid her face
    in her hands I could not but see that her left eye was bruised and that
    there were red weals across her shoulders as though from a cane.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aghast, I snatched off the coverlet and beheld her shivering, naked body
    covered with red blotches.
  </p>
  <p>“What is this?</p>
  <p>” I cried.</p>
  <p>“Are you ill, or has someone beaten you?</p>
  <p>
    ” Giulia began to sob, and wailed, “I slipped and fell on those treacherous
    stairs, striking my eye and rolling right to the bottom.
  </p>
  <p>By a miracle I broke no bones.</p>
  <p>Can you wonder that I’m bruised and shivering?</p>
  <p>
    Alberto helped me to bed and when he had gone I drew off my shift to look at
    my bruises and rub them with salves.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hoped to be quite well again to welcome you tomorrow—and then you come
    storming in like a wild beast with no consideration for me whatever.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” She was talking so excitedly that I could not get a word in, and as I had
    often slipped on those stairs myself, especially after drinking wine, I had
    no reason to doubt her word and was aware only of a deep thankfulness that
    she had suffered no worse injury.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet somewhere in the depths of my heart that evening—though I would not
    admit it even to myself—the vile, scorching truth was revealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having humbly begged Giulia’s pardon for my thoughtless behavior, I called
    Abu el-Kasim to enter, since owing to her injuries Giulia could not leave
    her bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Abu was out of humor because Giulia had allowed the Russian nurse to go
    out with the other servants to celebrate the Sultan’s victories.
  </p>
  <p>
    He fidgeted about the room for some time, scratching himself, and at length
    set forth in search of the woman to protect her virtue from the mob.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was not sorry to see him go, for now at last Giulia and I could be alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inflamed by wine and my own suspicions I could not master myself, but
    embraced her to deaden my thoughts, though she begged me to spare her
    bruised body.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passion only burned the hotter as the agonizing truth forced its way
    deeper and deeper into my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giulia submitted ever more willingly and at last began to respond faintly to
    my caress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Artlessly she asked me whether I still loved her, and I could only grit my
    teeth and declare that of all women on earth I loved only her—that no other
    could satisfy my desire.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was the hideous truth and I hated myself for submitting to her spell.
  </p>
  <p>At length I sank to rest beside her, and she began to chide me gently.</p>
  <p>“What an unnatural father you are, Michael!</p>
  <p>You’ve not even asked after your daughter.</p>
  <p>Would you not like to peep at her while she’s asleep?</p>
  <p>
    You could never guess how she has grown and what a beautiful girl she
    promises to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” At this I could control my thoughts no longer and said, “No, no, I won’t
    see her.
  </p>
  <p>I won’t even think about her.</p>
  <p>She has Alberto.</p>
  <p>
    All I ask is to bury my thoughts, my will, my hopes, my future, and my
    bitter, bitter disillusionment in your arms.
  </p>
  <p>I love you only and can do no other.</p>
  <p>
    ” At my violent and despairing words she raised herself quickly on her
    elbow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her face was strangely flushed and there was a cruel look about her lips as
    she stared at me in the yellow lamplight.
  </p>
  <p>
    But dissimulation came easily to me now, and presently she shrugged her
    white shoulders and lay down calmly at my side, saying, “You talk very
    foolishly, Michael.
  </p>
  <p>You should not neglect your own child for my sake.</p>
  <p>
    Mirmah has often asked after you, and tomorrow you shall walk with her in
    the garden, to show both her and me that you’re a tender and thoughtful
    father, though I know you care little for children.
  </p>
  <p>So much at least you can do for me, when I ask you so prettily.</p>
  <p>
    ” Next morning she brought Mirmah to me and I took the child into the garden
    to look at my red and yellow Indian fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a while she held my hand obediently, as no doubt Giulia had bidden her,
    but soon she forgot me and began throwing sand into the water with both
    hands to scare the fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    I cared little for the fish, but narrowly scrutinized the child that Giulia
    called mine.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was in her fifth year —a capricious, violent child who went into
    convulsions if her smallest wish was opposed.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was beautiful; her features were regular and faultless as those of a
    Greek statue, and her complexion was so smooth and dark as to make her eyes
    seem strangely pale.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we strolled in the garden Alberto followed us like a shadow, as if
    fearing that I might throw the little girl into the pool.
  </p>
  <p>
    But how could I have harmed her who had no share in the sin or in the death
    of my heart?
  </p>
  <p>
    When she had tired of teasing the fish Alberto took her quickly away and I
    sat down on a stone bench that was warmed by the sun.
  </p>
  <p>My head was empty and I did not want to think.</p>
  <p>
    I was not many years over thirty, but the gnawing uncertainty of my’
    imprisonment had led me to doubt the purpose of my life, and on my return
    the corroding truth took up its dwelling in my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was overcome by a desperate longing to flee from the city of the Sultan
    and find somewhere—as far away as possible—a peaceful corner where I might
    live out my life like other men and in quietness increase my knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet how could I give up Giulia and my beautiful house, my comfortable bed,
    the good food served in porcelain and silver, my friends the poets and
    dervishes and above all the Grand Vizier who trusted and needed me?
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not desert him—least of all now, when despite his brilliant
    successes the shadows were clustering thick about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    I strove to make a bold decision, but I could not tell what was best for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time slipped by like a swift stream, the worm gnawed at my heart, and vainly
    I sought comfort in my cups and oblivion in cheerful company.
  </p>
  <p>
    p y To all appearances, the Ottoman Empire had never known so golden an age.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conquest of Tunis had brought with it control of Africa’s ancient
    caravan routes over the desert from the Negro lands; along these routes
    poured gold dust, black slaves, ivory, and ostrich feathers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tunis was also a base for the conquest of Sicily, and already the Knights of
    St.
  </p>
  <p>
    John—the greatest menace afloat—were thinking of withdrawing from Malta to
    the security of the Italian mainland.
  </p>
  <p>
    From Tabriz the united armies of the Sultan and the Grand Vizier embarked
    upon an arduous march to Bagdad, and news of the bloodless capture of the
    holy city of the caliphs came as a climax to many victorious tidings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet these successes could not provoke Shah Tahmasp to a decisive encounter,
    and the march on Bagdad claimed more than its share of victims.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received a letter from the Grand Vizier of which the very handwriting
    betrayed a disturbed state of mind, commanding me to join him in Bagdad.
  </p>
  <p>The war was by no means ended.</p>
  <p>
    The army was to winter in Bagdad and in the spring renew its attack on
    Persia.
  </p>
  <p>
    But treachery lurked among the troops, he wrote, and did more damage than
    the weapons of the Persians.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iskender-tseleb the Defterdar was the cause of all the trouble, and since
    Aleppo he had brought about utter confusion in the finances.
  </p>
  <p>
    He had deliberately sent ten thousand men to certain death in an
    inaccessible mountain pass, and it was becoming more and more evident that
    the whole campaign had been planned to discredit Ibrahim as Seraskier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ibrahim must be constantly on his guard against assassins—who were not sent
    by Shah Tahmasp.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, he wrote, he would turn the conspiracies of his foes against
    themselves; he would root out the treachery that had sprung up in the army
    and show who was Seraskier-sultan of the Ottoman Empire.
  </p>
  <p>
    From me he required a report of all that had happened in the Seraglio during
    his absence, and meant to entrust to me a further task, which could not be
    mentioned even in a secret dispatch.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was filled with forebodings and fears that the noble Seraskier, distracted
    by the hardships and reverses of the war, had taken to suspecting treachery
    in the most innocent places.
  </p>
  <p>Yet since he commanded me, I must go to him.</p>
  <p>
    I will therefore begin my last book and relate how Grand Vizier Ibrahim’s
    star burned dim just as he attained to the highest position ever held by a
    slave in the Ottoman Empire.

  <p>
    com Grand Vizier Ibrahim’s Star of Fortune BY FAIR words Abu el-Kasim
    persuaded my daughter’s Russian nurse to renounce her Greek religion and
    embrace Islam, that he might marry her lawfully in the presence of the cadi
    and two qualified witnesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The woman so warmly admired Abu’s broad turban, his kaftan with the jeweled
    buttons, and his glittering monkey’s eyes, that she clapped her hands for
    joy when she understood his honorable intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I knew not whether to laugh or cry when I saw how tender Abu was of his
    wife’s reputation and how he even overcame his avarice for the time, that
    the wedding celebrations might be as splendid as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the poor of the quarter were feasted for many days in succession, pipes
    and drums resounded, and women sang in shrill voices their ancient nuptial
    hymns.
  </p>
  <p>
    To my delight Giulia made no opposition, though she failed to understand how
    I could hand over a woman still in her prime to such a man as Abu, still
    less incite her to renounce her Christian faith, schismatic though it was.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abu el-Kasim swore that he would make her son his sole heir if he should
    have no children by her, and at the boy’s circumcision he gave him the name
    of Kasim, so that in Tunis it might be thought that he was Abu’s son.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time I received the Grand Vizier’s anxious letter from Bagdad I had
    already accompanied Abu el-Kasim and his family to their vessel and seen
    them off with many blessings.
  </p>
  <p>
    A singular, almost morbid conviction had grown upon me of late that a curse
    lay over my house, and I rejoiced at the Grand Vizier’s summons, plainly
    though it showed that the stress of war had deranged his mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dread of my own house inclined me to this long journey, and as feverishly as
    during my imprisonment I had longed for Giulia, I now yearned to be parted
    from her for a time, that I might meditate in peace and quiet upon her and
    upon our relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giulia made no objection to my journey, envied me my sight of Bagdad, and
    gave me a long list of things to buy for her in the bazaars.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the day of departure drew near she displayed increasing affection, but
    shortly before I left she spoke a few grave words.
  </p>
  <p>
    “According to news received by a certain distinguished lady, Grand Vizier
    Ibrahim has secretly summoned to Bagdad a number of eminent statesmen, and
    it’s certain that he is up to no good.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Sultan, blinded and bewitched by his friendship, cannot see the
    danger, though the ambitious Ibrahim has assumed a new title and in the
    Persian manner signs himself Seraskier-sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately Khurrem was able to persuade the Sultan to send thither the
    loyal Defterdar, Iskender-
  </p>
  <p>£, to advise the Seraskier and at the same time to hold him in check.</p>
  <p>
    Yet Ibrahim has tried in every way to hinder Iskender-Arc-/e£ in his work
    and to undermine his authority.
  </p>
  <p>” “I know all this,” I replied curtly.</p>
  <p>
    Her words distressed me, for the attempt, foiled by the vigilance of the
    Grand Vizier, to steal part of the Sultan’s war funds had aroused much
    excitement throughout Istanbul and fantastic rumors were current in the
    Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>But nothing would deter Giulia from pouring poison into my ear.</p>
  <p>“Believe me, Michael—be wise and don’t walk blindfold into disaster.</p>
  <p>Take careful note of all the Grand Vizier says.</p>
  <p>Calm him; prevent any hasty or ill-considered action.</p>
  <p>
    For although Sultana Khurrem wishes him no ill, he will be setting the noose
    about his own neck if he continues to persecute her friends and faithful
    servants.
  </p>
  <p>Iskender-£r</p>
  <p>
    £ in particular enjoys the Sultana’s favor, and it was only to cast
    suspicion upon him that Ibrahim bribed men to steal the camels laden with
    part of the war funds.
  </p>
  <p>” “I take a very different view of that incident,” said I.</p>
  <p>“Why should the Seraskier steal his own money?</p>
  <p>
    And besides, he has the written confession of the accused—a confession which
    throws a strange light upon the Defterdar, as should be evident to all
    right-thinking persons.
  </p>
  <p>” Giulia’s face darkened.</p>
  <p>“And it was extorted under merciless torture!</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps you can explain why the Grand Vizier was in so great a hurry to take
    the lives of those unhappy men as soon as they had confessed, if not to
    silence inconvenient witnesses.
  </p>
  <p>” “Allah be gracious to me!</p>
  <p>” I cried in exasperation.</p>
  <p>“Only a woman could reason thus.</p>
  <p>How in wartime could he have pardoned the men so dangerous an offense?</p>
  <p>
    As Seraskier, he was compelled to make an example of them, to prevent the
    spread of sedition.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” A queer gleam came into Giulia’s eyes, but with a great effort she
    controlled herself and answered, “You refuse to see the truth, Michael, and
    you will have a terrible awakening.
  </p>
  <p>Don’t blame me if when the time comes I can do nothing to save you.</p>
  <p>
    I wish you a good journey to your dear Grand Vizier, and hope that on the
    way you will find time to think the matter over.
  </p>
  <p>Be sure that rich rewards await you if you come to your senses in time.</p>
  <p>
    ” According to Ibrahim’s commands, I traveled the long road to Bagdad with
    the greatest possible speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was blind and deaf with exhaustion, my cramped limbs ached, and I was in
    agony from saddle sores when at length I slipped from my mount with my
    companions to press an aching brow to the ground and stammer prayers of
    thanksgiving.
  </p>
  <p>
    The countless mosques, minarets, and towers of this fabled city were like a
    mirage amid the flowering gardens crisscrossed with irrigation canals, and
    the holy tombs of Islam lay more thickly here than anywhere else in the
    world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bagdad was no longer the city of the caliphs, for after the days of the
    great Imam the g y p y g Mongols had looted and burned it more than once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet in my eyes it seemed rich and splendid, and with all the tales of Arabia
    in my thoughts I rode in through the city gates preceded by runners who
    hastened to inform the Grand Vizier of our coming.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we slowly crossed the empty, arcaded market place I saw in the middle a
    gallows guarded by janissaries, from which hung the body of a bearded man.
  </p>
  <p>
    The unexpected sight aroused my curiosity; I rode nearer and to my amazement
    recognized that face, now blue in death, and the well-known shabby kaftan
    with its ink-stained sleeves.
  </p>
  <p>“Allah is Allah!</p>
  <p>” I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“Is this not the body of Defterdar Iskender-tseleb?</p>
  <p>
    How comes it that this man—the richest, noblest, and most learned in the
    Ottoman Empire—hangs on this gallows like the meanest malefactor?
  </p>
  <p>
    Could he not at least have been given the green silken noose, so that in the
    name of the Compassionate he might have taken his own life in the privacy of
    his room?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Some of the high court officials who had journeyed with me in obedience to
    Ibrahim’s summons hid their faces, turned their horses, and rode back to the
    gates, determined to leave the city without delay.
  </p>
  <p>
    The janissaries guarding the gibbet said fiercely, “It is all the fault of
    the accursed Grand Vizier.
  </p>
  <p>The Sultan is innocent, and we never begged this honor.</p>
  <p>Who can doubt now that Ibrahim is plotting against the Ottoman Empire?</p>
  <p>
    The mufti proclaimed a jatwa entitling us to plunder these heretics of their
    possessions and to sell them into slavery.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Seraskier Ibrahim, that winebibber and blasphemer, denies us our right
    to pillage.
  </p>
  <p>We should like to know how much the merchants have paid him for that.</p>
  <p>
    Wages cannot compensate for this injustice and serve only to show that Grand
    Vizier Ibrahim is suffering from a tender conscience.
  </p>
  <p>” One could sympathize with the janissaries if their tale was true.</p>
  <p>
    IskcnAcr-tseleb’s wealth, piety, and pure Turkish origins had won him great
    regard throughout the Ottoman Empire, so that indeed it can have been no
    pleasure to stand sentinel over his dangling corpse.
  </p>
  <p>I rode on, oppressed by dark forebodings.</p>
  <p>
    At the palace chosen by the Grand Vizier for his headquarters I was received
    with the greatest suspicion; my clothes were repeatedly searched by the
    guards, who even ripped up the seams of my kaftan in search of poison and
    hidden weapons.
  </p>
  <p>From this I realized the state of terror prevailing in Bagdad.</p>
  <p>
    When at length I was led by the elbow into the presence of the Grand Vizier,
    I found him too greatly agitated to keep still.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was pacing up and down the marble room, his handsome features were puffy
    and his eyes bloodshot with strain and lack of sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    His usually well-kept nails were bitten, and he paused often to take a
    draught of spiced wine.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the sight of me he forgot all his dignity and hurried forward to embrace
    me.
  </p>
  <p>
    He dismissed the guards and cried, “At last I behold one known and trusted
    face among the traitors!
  </p>
  <p>
    Blessed be your coming, Michael el-Hakim, for never did I stand in such need
    of a clearsighted, impartial friend.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” As coolly and dispassionately as he could he gave me a brief account of
    the progress of the campaign since the departure from Aleppo, and as I
    thought the matter over I saw that Ibrahim was in possession of so many
    proofs of Iskender-tseleb’s treachery as to leave no room for doubt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against the Seraskier’s will, Iskender had been appointed kehaya, or
    steward, of the army and, blinded by his hatred of the Grand Vizier, he had
    acted throughout the campaign against the best interests of the troops.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not until the outset of the terrible winter march from Tabriz to Bagdad was
    Ibrahim able to persuade the Sultan to dismiss the Defterdar from his post
    as kehaya, and then it was too late, for when snow set in and floods came
    and roads were transformed into bottomless swamps, the wretched state of the
    supplies and equipment was revealed, as also the confusion and disorder
    brought about by secret agents.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier did not hesitate to cast the blame on Iskender-tseleb both
    for the ruinous condition of the baggage wagons and for the lack of forage,
    as a result of which the draft animals dropped from exhaustion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kehaya’s reconnaissance and route planning had been most imperfect;
    indeed, he seemed to have chosen the worst roads in order to undermine the
    morale of the troops and to incite them to revolt against the Seraskier.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Vanity led me to follow his deceitful counsels and march on Tabriz without
    waiting for the Sultan to join me, for it would have been a triumph if I
    could have defeated the Shah unaided,” said Ibrahim candidly.
  </p>
  <p>
    “All too late I realized that Iskender’s encouragement was born of his
    secret wish to destroy me and discredit me in the eyes of my lord and
    sovereign.
  </p>
  <p>
    I now have proof that the Defterdar was in secret communication with the
    Persians throughout the whole march and gave them all needful information as
    to our routes and objectives, so that they were able to withdraw in time and
    avoid a pitched battle.
  </p>
  <p>If that is not treachery, tell me what is!</p>
  <p>In the end it was either his head or mine.</p>
  <p>Yet since his execution I’ve been oppressed by a feeling of impotence.</p>
  <p>I feel caught in a net.</p>
  <p>My head is at stake, and there is no one whom I can trust.</p>
  <p>
    ” As we sat drinking wine together, agitated servants in gilded helmets
    hurried in to tell us that the Sultan had woken from his midday rest and
    seemed out of his mind.
  </p>
  <p>He was screaming and tearing at his breast and no one could quiet him.</p>
  <p>
    Together Ibrahim and I raced to the Sultan’s bedchamber, where we found him
    standing in the middle of the floor staring into space.
  </p>
  <p>His face was wet with sweat, and he trembled all over.</p>
  <p>
    The sight of the Grand Vizier seemed to bring him to himself; he wiped his
    face and dismissed all anxious questions with the words, “I had a bad dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” His nightmare had been so terrible that he refused to speak of it, and the
    Grand Vizier proposed that they should visit the baths together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of their many cares and anxieties they had both drunk too much and
    so become a prey to nightmares and even waking illusions.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Sultan was plunged in his own thoughts; his eyes were lowered and he
    would not look the Grand Vizier in the face.
  </p>
  <p>
    The execution of Iskender-£re/e£, which had caused such an uproar in Bagdad,
    nevertheless cleared the air and made plain to everyone who was master.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of its results was to bring about a shuffle of appointments by which
    some found themselves a rung higher in the hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>These had every reason to feel grateful to the Grand Vizier.</p>
  <p>
    Moreover the newly conquered provinces in Persia offered new and profitable
    posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    By means of these and other measures superficial order was restored, and
    there were even cheers to be heard when the Sultan and the Grand Vizier
    together rode to the mosque or to the holy tombs in the neighborhood of the
    city.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the course of these devotional exercises the Sultan was always greatly
    saddened by the fact that Shiites had long since destroyed the tomb of the
    founder of Sunna, the wise Abu-Hanif, and in their heretic frenzy had even
    burned his holy bones, so that no orthodox Sun- nite had since then been
    able to pay homage to the greatest saint of the true path.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though discontent in the army was temporarily allayed, the Grand Vizier
    thought with some uneasiness of the coming spring and the renewed campaigns
    against Persia.
  </p>
  <p>
    He engaged a learned historian to chronicle the course of events, and having
    thus ensured a fair and impartial record he questioned the learned man as to
    previous campaigns, constantly reverting to the story of Eiup, the Prophet’s
    stand- ard-bearer, and demanding to know every detail of his life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eiup had died a hero’s death before the impregnable walls of Constantinople,
    and hundreds of years later his sacred bones were mysteriously found in the
    forgotten grave—a discovery that fired the janissaries of Muhammed the
    Conqueror at the final victorious assault on Constantinople.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was a strange light in Ibrahim’s eyes as he said to me, “Such another
    find would be very welcome just now, to inspire the troops with courage and
    enthusiasm.
  </p>
  <p>Yet I fear the days of miracles are past.</p>
  <p>” I am resolved to express no opinion about what followed.</p>
  <p>
    According to a secret tradition handed down among the descendants of one of
    the guards of Abu-Hanif’s tomb, this guard rejected the Shiite heresy,
    rescued the saint’s remains, and buried them elsewhere, replacing them by
    those of a heretic.
  </p>
  <p>
    These false bones had afterward been burned, but the sacred relics of the
    great teacher were in safekeeping somewhere within the walls of Bagdad.
  </p>
  <p>
    This story was told, for a consideration, to one of the Sultan’s attendants
    by a direct descendant of the watchman.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attendant related it to the Grand Vizier, who commanded a certain devout
    and learned man named Tashkun to seek out the resting place of the bones.
  </p>
  <p>
    After much research and diligent peering among the ruins, Tashkun ordered
    his men to dig up the floor of a certain dilapidated house.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ancient vault was revealed, through one of whose walls came a heavenly
    fragrance of musk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hearing of this discovery, the Grand Vizier at once hastened to the spot and
    with his own hands pulled away a few stones, leaving a gap large enough to
    crawl through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus the resting place of the great Imam was discovered and its sanctity
    vouched for by the mysterious fragrance.
  </p>
  <p>
    An express messenger was sent to the Sultan, who came in haste and descended
    into the tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
    The army could now see for themselves that by the grace of Allah, Ibrahim
    and Suleiman had rediscovered the long-lost but miraculously preserved
    remains.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultan spent nearly a day and a night at the tomb in prayer and fasting,
    and his fervor infected the troops; even the dullest could see that
    Abu-Hanif hoped for the uprooting of the Shiite heresy, so that the path of
    Sunna, which he had founded, might take the place of honor in every country
    of Islam.
  </p>
  <p>
    I naturally visited the tomb myself and saw the yellow-brown skull and the
    skeleton in its rotting shroud, and I was able to satisfy myself that these
    remains gave out the same scent that I remembered from my boyhood when, as a
    reward for scholarship, I was allowed to help at the enshrining of holy
    Hemming’s bones in Abo cathedral.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless this strange and timely discovery caused me some distress of
    mind, and at a convenient moment I inquired of the Grand Vizier how it had
    come about.
  </p>
  <p>He was far from being a devout man.</p>
  <p>Was it deliberate deception, I asked him, or some diabolical illusion?</p>
  <p>
    Grand Vizier Ibrahim looked upon me with shining eyes, and his whole being
    seemed purified by his prayer and fasting as in a firm and convincing tone
    he replied, “Believe me or not, Michael, the discovery of those bones was
    the greatest surprise of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had planned to deceive and with the help of my most faithful dervishes I
    buried some bones of suitable holiness for pious, credulous old Tashkun to
    find.
  </p>
  <p>No doubt they lie hidden to this day.</p>
  <p>
    I was far more amazed than Tashkun when thanks to his drearns and other
    visions he actually found Abu-Hanif’s tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
    Surely if such things can befall me, the star of my fortune cannot fail to
    reach the zenith.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” But the suspicions of the Seraglio had poisoned my mind, and his words did
    not convince me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The discovery of Abu-Hanif’s holy bones eclipsed all unpleasant or
    troublesome memories, and the army spent the remainder of the winter in
    feasting and merrymaking.
  </p>
  <p>With the coming of spring the Grand Vizier grew more serene.</p>
  <p>His despair melted away and gave place to an exhilarated, joyful mood.</p>
  <p>Nothing seemed impossible, and the whole world witnessed his triumphs.</p>
  <p>
    He had sent word to Venice and Vienna of the capture of Bagdad, and even now
    the French ambassador with a brilliant retinue was on his way with
    felicitations and proposals for an alliance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ibrahim seemed to have attained the climax of his fame and glory;
    nevertheless he was not blinded by it, and before I left that beautiful city
    he sent for me to give me my final instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’ve had enough of treachery and in future I will show no mercy to any who
    plot against me.
  </p>
  <p>
    You must go to Khaireddin in Tunis, and if you value your head keep him from
    succumbing to the blandishments of either the Seraglio or the Emperor; let
    him remember his debt to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was not to help him extend his own kingdom that I made him Kapudan-pasha,
    and he must now keep Doria and the Emperor busy at sea so that I need not
    give a thought to what goes on behind my back while I’m waging war in
    Persia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Impress this on him, or he may lose his horsehair switches as suddenly as he
    came by them.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” In proof of his favor and his continued trust he bestowed such princely
    gifts upon me as to surpass my wildest hopes.
  </p>
  <p>
    From them I gained some notion of the sums the Bagdad merchants must have
    paid him for protection; from them also I glimpsed the glorious future
    awaiting me if fortune continued to smile upon him and I proved myself
    worthy of his trust.
  </p>
  <p>I came home to find Giulia in a state of agitation.</p>
  <p>“The Seraglio is in an uproar over the murder of Iskender-to?</p>
  <p>and Ibrahim has not a single friend left.</p>
  <p>
    He has shown that neither fortune, birth, merit, nor the most tested
    fidelity in the Sultan’s service can protect a man from his mad lust for
    blood.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” This and much more she said, but I paid little heed, being still full of
    the wonder of Bagdad, and I had not the smallest doubt that despite all
    intrigues the Grand Vizier’s star of fortune was now rising to its zenith.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon after my return a wealthy Jewish dealer in precious stones called upon
    me, honored me with many fine presents, and by way of introduction brought
    me greetings from Aaron in Vienna.
  </p>
  <p>
    After mutual expressions of esteem he said, “You’re the friend of the great
    Khaireddin, Michael el-Hakim, and it seems that last summer when Khaireddin
    attacked Tunis, Sultan Muley-Hassan was forced to flee from his kasbah.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his fright he left behind him a red velvet bag containing two hundred
    selected diamonds of considerable size.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the list of presents sent by Khaireddin to the Sultan there is no mention
    of these stones, and no trace of their sale has been found either in
    Istanbul, Aleppo, or Cairo.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have made many inquiries about the matter among my colleagues in different
    cities, for as you may fancy, so considerable a treasure aroused my
    curiosity.
  </p>
  <p>
    You need not regret speaking openly to me, Michael el-Hakim, and telling me
    all you know of this.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would offer you the highest possible prices and assure you of my silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    If necessary I can sell these diamonds in India and even China without
    anything becoming known of the matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am accustomed to such traffic, and if as I suppose the Grand Vizier is
    concerned in it—for it represents a vast fortune—he need feel no uneasiness
    about the consequences.
  </p>
  <p>” “Allah is Allah!</p>
  <p>” I exclaimed in some indignation.</p>
  <p>“Where did you hear all this nonsense?</p>
  <p>
    And how dare you insult the Grand Vizier by mentioning his name in the same
    breath with such an affair?
  </p>
  <p>I have never even heard of these diamonds.</p>
  <p>
    ” But the Jew swore to the truth of what he said and in an attempt to
    convince me he went on, “Muley-Hassan himself laments his loss in a letter
    to the Emperor—a letter actually seen by a colleague of mine.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Tunisian Sultan’s ambassador to the Imperial Court has openly boasted of
    it, to draw attention to his lord’s wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Aghast, I seized the Jew by the beard, and shaking his head by it I cried,
    “Wretch, what are you saying?
  </p>
  <p>What is Muley-Hassan’s ambassador doing at the Emperor’s Court?</p>
  <p>
    ” The honest Jew freed his beard and said reproachfully, “Are you a stranger
    in the city?
  </p>
  <p>The news is in every man’s mouth.</p>
  <p>The Knights of St.</p>
  <p>
    John and the Pope himself have besought the Emperor to drive Khaireddin from
    Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sultan Muley-Hassan has appealed to the Emperor; he declares that all his
    misfortunes have resulted from his loyalty to Charles, and so for his own
    sake Charles must at least try to help him.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” If all this was true it was indeed high time for me to hasten to Tunis,
    carry out my task there, and hurry away before the Emperor’s attack.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ought to have relied more on Ibrahim’s foresight and not dallied so long
    on the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I therefore hastily dismissed the Jew with renewed assurances that I knew
    nothing of his diamonds, and with promises to inquire secretly into the
    matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    This I did merely to be rid of him, for I had other things to think of now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fair winds and a swift galley brought me to the yellow Tunisian coast and
    within sight of the Fortress of La Goletta, from whose tower floated
    Khaireddin’s green and red standard with its silver crescent.
  </p>
  <p>Great activity prevailed.</p>
  <p>
    Trenches were being dug, barricades erected, and thousands of half-naked,
    sunburned Spanish and Italian slaves were widening the canal to Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    This city is situated on the shores of a shallow salt lake and is separated
    from the sea by swamps.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sight of Khaireddin’s war galleys anchored in long rows in the harbor
    greatly relieved and cheered me, g g y but not until I approached the city
    itself did I realize the true significance of Khaireddin’s latest capture.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had indeed heard much of the wealth and might of Tunis, but discounted
    much of it as flights of fancy on the part of Khaireddin and Sinan the Jew.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the city walls there were, besides the kas- bah and the great mosque,
    about twenty thousand houses, or at least two hundred thousand people; Tunis
    could thus compare with the great cities of Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not even Khaireddin knew the number of Christian slaves, but I fancy their
    number did not exceed twenty thousand.
  </p>
  <p>
    To my great delight I saw that the reconquest of Tunis for MuleyHassan would
    be no easy task even for the Emperor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only by cunning and the incitement of the inhabitants to revolt had
    Khaireddin contrived to enter it, and even after Muley-Hassan’s flight there
    had been long and bloody street fighting before the people laid down their
    arms.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sturdy, defiant towers of La Goletta appeared impregnable and blocked
    the road that ran along the canal into the city, while numberless little
    lakes and poisonous swamps on either side of this canal made encirclement
    almost impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin received me with every sign of delight, embracing me like a
    long-lost son and entertaining me so lavishly that I began to fear the
    worst.
  </p>
  <p>
    He gave me no opportunity of speaking, but boasted loudly of his defenses
    and the savage lesson he would give the Emperor and Doria if they came too
    near Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I inquired how it was that his proud ships lay at anchor instead of
    sailing forth to engage Doria in open combat, he turned very sulky and asked
    for the latest news of the war in Persia and of Iskender-ta?
  </p>
  <p>/e£’.</p>
  <p>
    r execution, of which he had heard only the mendacious rumors of the
    Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Was it indeed true that Grand Vizier Ibrahim had gone out of his mind and
    ran about on all fours foaming at the mouth and chewing the carpets?
  </p>
  <p>
    To this I replied sharply that such a tale was nothing but malicious
    invention.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin listened attentively, stroking his beard, and I fancied I saw a
    guilty look in those prominent eyes of his, as of a child caught out in some
    misdeed.
  </p>
  <p>My misgivings increased.</p>
  <p>
    The same evening, therefore, I sought out Abu el-Kasim, since Andy was
    outside the city directing the fortifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abu had bought himself a pleasant house with a walled garden and had so far
    overcome his avarice as to furnish it richly and buy a flock of slaves to
    wait upon his wife and son.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at him now it was easy to forget that he was nothing but a petty
    merchant who had made his fortune by adulterating drugs and inventing new
    names for age-old ointments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like a proud father he led the splendidly dressed Kasim forward to greet me,
    and seemed to imagine I had forgotten that the boy was not his son.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrary to Moslem custom he allowed his Russian wife y to approach me with
    only a thin veil over her face, hoping to elicit my admiration for her
    gorgeous clothes and jewels, beside which he looked like a gray spider.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having sent wife and son back to the harem, Abu el-Kasim offered me wine and
    said in a worried tone, “Khaireddin’s janissaries and renegades are perhaps
    not the best shepherds in the world, and their manner of fleecing their
    sheep has aroused much discontent among the inhabitants of Tunis—above all
    among the old Arab families who under Tunisian sultans were members of the
    Divan and could manage the city as they pleased.
  </p>
  <p>A month or so ago a Spanish merchant arrived here.</p>
  <p>
    He seems to have no notion of the nature or value of his wares, and sells
    the most precious of them to chosen customers for a mere song in the hope of
    winning their favor.
  </p>
  <p>
    He sells spices and even perfumes without the least reference to the prices
    agreed upon among the merchants here, so you may judge of my indignation
    when I heard of him.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Abu el-Kasim assumed an injured air and looked sideways at me as he sipped
    his wine.
  </p>
  <p>
    “This Spaniard has in his service a Christian Moor who is far too much
    inclined to wander about after dark—not with sighs and a rose in his hand,
    but on visits to Muley-Hassan’s warmest adherents and other malcontents.
  </p>
  <p>
    From sheer curiosity I have had these two men shadowed and several times the
    Spaniard has openly visited the kasbah and offered merchandise to no less a
    man than Khaireddin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only that, but Khaireddin has had lengthy conversations with him in
    private.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m prepared to wager that the foreigner is an Imperial agent and probably a
    Spanish nobleman, since he behaves so foolishly and has a Christian Moor for
    a servant.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” We talked far into the night, and next morning I betook myself to the
    harbor and went aboard the Spaniard’s ship on the pretext of buying a good
    Venetian hand mirror.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Moorish servant informed his master that a wealthy and
    distinguished customer had arrived, the Spaniard hurried up on deck and
    greeted me with marked respect.
  </p>
  <p>
    From his features, hands, and bearing I saw at once that he had never grown
    up among drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    He soon led the conversation round to world affairs, and when I told him
    that I had just arrived from the Seraglio in Istanbul to enter Khaireddin’s
    service, he displayed great eagerness to learn the latest news.
  </p>
  <p>
    I told him truthfully of the unrest in the Seraglio and of the suspicions
    concerning Grand Vizier Ibrahim, and of how, despite the capture of Bagdad,
    no one believed in a happy outcome to the war in Persia.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point in my narrative I abandoned truth for fiction and remarked
    that I had felt the time ripe for seeking a new master since no man, however
    perfect his integrity, could hope to escape the Grand Vizier’s morbid
    suspicions.
  </p>
  <p>
    From my complaints the Spaniard p y p p judged me to have committed some
    misdemeanor and escaped to Tunis beyond the reach of Ibrahim’s wrath.
  </p>
  <p>
    He at once invited me into his luxuriously appointed stateroom and asked me
    where I was born and how I had come to take the turban.
  </p>
  <p>
    As if in passing he mentioned that the Pope, on the Emperor’s
    recommendation, had recently permitted certain eminent renegades to be
    received again into the bosom of the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of the great services they had rendered the Emperor he had even
    pardoned them their falling away, without asking too many awkward questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Few words were needed, therefore, to bring us into perfect understanding,
    and the Spaniard now confided that his name was Luis de Presandes, that he
    had been born in Genoa, belonged to Charles’s personal suite, and enjoyed
    his full confidence in all the complicated affairs that were commonly placed
    in his hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Charles was shortly to sail for Tunis with the mightiest navy ever seen.
  </p>
  <p>
    The patriotic inhabitants were ready to rise when the time came and support
    the Emperor, having had enough of the Turkish reign of terror; they longed
    for the noble Muley-Hassan, their rightful sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wise man must trim his sails to the veering wind, and all the world knew
    the Emperor to be a just ruler; he would not forget any man who sincerely
    repented of past errors and now did his part for the good cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    But fearful would be the punishment for any renegade who persisted in
    denying his faith and serving the Turks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In such words as these he sought both to lure and to frighten me, and in the
    name of Christ and His mother he exhorted me to recall the faith of my
    childhood, return to the Christian fellowship, and so win pardon for my
    grievous sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    He wept as he spoke and I too shed tears, being tenderhearted and ever
    susceptible to beautiful words.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless I would make no promises, nor would I accept the earnest money
    he offered me, for through Andy I had conceived the greatest respect for the
    articles of war and the binding nature of such payments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet we parted like bosom friends, and I promised to think over his proposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    I furthermore swore by Cross and Koran never to breathe a word of what he
    had said.
  </p>
  <p>
    This oath put me in an awkward position, but his own missionary zeal
    inspired me with an idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    After only two days Abu el-Kasim succeeded in persuading Master Presandes’s
    Moorish servant to remember with a contrite heart the Moslem faith of his
    forefathers and, in terror of the hideous punishment that awaited apostates,
    disclose his master’s plots.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without breaking my promise I could thus confront Khaireddin and say, “What
    has the Kapudan-pasha of the High Porte to do with the secret emissary of
    the Emperor?
  </p>
  <p>What is in your mind, Khaireddin?</p>
  <p>
    Do you really believe the Grand Vizier’s arm is too short to reach you, even
    from Persia?
  </p>
  <p>” Khaireddin was much startled and began hastily to defend himself.</p>
  <p>
    “The noble Presandes is the Emperor’s plenipotentiary and thus enjoys
    diplomatic immunity.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve kept him dangling only to gain time for completing the defenses of
    Tunis, and could not receive him openly without arousing suspicion among the
    Grand Vizier’s agents.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is the whole truth, Michael, and I beg you won’t misinterpret my
    perfecdy innocent actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He stroked his beard uneasily, and his whole appearance betrayed fear and
    a guilty conscience.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I disclosed the Spaniard’s secret plan for inciting the inhabitants of
    Tunis to armed revolt, to coincide with the Emperor’s arrival, and also
    handed him a list, given me by the Moor, of dependable sheiks and merchants
    recommended to Presandes by Muley-Hassan’s envoy in Madrid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin’s face darkened; he tore his beard in rage, and with a roar that
    shook the walls of the kasbah he said, “That hound of an unbeliever has
    betrayed me!
  </p>
  <p>
    He showed me the Emperor’s written instructions by which he was authorized
    to offer me the independent sovereignty of Algeria, Tunis, and other cities,
    on condition I left the Sultan’s service.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have not the smallest intention of leaving the Sultan, to whose favor I
    owe my high position.
  </p>
  <p>But all favors are precarious.</p>
  <p>
    Therefore I thought I should lose nothing by conversing with Presandes and
    profiting by the Emperor’s generous terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Emperor is clearly falser than I could have believed, and never
    again will I put my faith in Christian oaths.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I realized from this agitated confession that the Spaniard was not quite
    so simple and inexperienced as I had thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the contrary, he had secured his position and fancied that Khaireddin
    would let him go even were someone to denounce him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin, he thought, would laugh up his sleeve at such a denunciation,
    believing himself to know more of the Spaniard’s business in Tunis than
    anyone.
  </p>
  <p>Now, however, Khaireddin had him arrested at once.</p>
  <p>
    In a secret hiding place aboard his vessel another of the Emperor’s
    instructions was found, clearly demonstrating the deceit and treachery of
    his negotiations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite Master de Presandes’s loudly repeated claims to diplomatic immunity,
    the sword fell; his protests were silenced forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being now fully aware of Khaireddin’s irresolute and vacillating nature I
    made ready to leave Tunis, as I had a dislike of violence and bloodshed.
  </p>
  <p>
    But precious time slipped away unnoticed, storms and bad weather hindered my
    departure, Abu el-Kasim’s hospitality enticed me evening after evening, and
    above all I hoped to see Andy before my departure, to persuade him to return
    with me to Istanbul.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not until I met him barefoot, ragged, and dirty in the courtyard of the
    kasbah did I learn that Khaireddin had never told him of my coming, and
    indeed had sought on various pretexts to keep us apart.
  </p>
  <p>
    This g p p p was understandable enough, for like a prudent general
    Khaireddin was unwilling to lose a good master gunner just before the
    outbreak of war.
  </p>
  <p>
    We embraced one another joyfully and Andy exclaimed, “I’ve had enough of
    this place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin made me a laughingstock in the eyes of all decent gunners last
    winter, when we were fighting Berbers and Arabs in the desert.
  </p>
  <p>
    He made me rig sails to our cannon, and of course they were of some help on
    level ground with a following wind.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when I saw my honest guns flying along like so many drabs with lifted
    petticoats I was ashamed.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Khaireddin just laughed and bent on larger sails, and I can never quite
    forgive him for the disgrace.
  </p>
  <p>I much doubt whether he is capable of land fighting.</p>
  <p>
    And then the savage treatment of Christian slaves has cut me to the heart,
    so I shall be more than glad to come back with you to Istanbul.
  </p>
  <p>” Andy now looked like a Greek monk or some pious dervish.</p>
  <p>
    He had let his beard grow till it stood out round his face like a jungle,
    and I felt it was time to take him in hand before he turned quite queer in
    the head.
  </p>
  <p>But he said, “At heart I’ve always been a good-natured fellow.</p>
  <p>
    My losses and sorrows have led me to understand people better than before,
    and I cannot see why we must be forever hurting one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you had seen how the renegades and janissaries treated the captive
    Italian boys and women—I can’t believe that the purpose of this life is
    witless destruction and slaughter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brooding over these things has given me headaches that the African sun does
    nothing to cure.
  </p>
  <p>
    So now I punish my body for all its misdeeds by fasting, and letting the sun
    scorch my back.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I seized him by the arm to lead him quickly to the baths and thence to Abu
    el-Kasim’s house to dress him in proper clothes.
  </p>
  <p>
    But at the gate of the kasbah Andy remembered something, and with a strange
    look at me he said, “I have something to show you.
  </p>
  <p>” He led me past the stables to the middens, and there gave a whistle.</p>
  <p>
    A ragged seven-year-old boy crept from his hiding place and greeted him with
    a yelp of pleasure, just as a dog welcomes its master.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boy had a red velvet cap upon his head but his eyes were almost closed,
    so swollen were they by the bites of flies.
  </p>
  <p>
    His arms and legs were thin and crooked, and his dull expression showed him
    to be feeble minded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless Andy took him and tossed him into the air until he howled with
    delight, then gave him a piece of bread and a bunch of onions from the
    wallet at his girdle.
  </p>
  <p>At length he said to me, “Give him an asper!</p>
  <p>But it must be newly minted and shiny.</p>
  <p>” I did so, in the name of the Compassionate.</p>
  <p>
    The boy looked at Andy, who nodded, then disappeared behind the heaps of
    garbage.
  </p>
  <p>
    He soon returned and after another glance at Andy he gave me in return a
    dirty pebble.
  </p>
  <p>I took it to please him, and pretended to put it in y p p p p my purse.</p>
  <p>Then wearying of the game I urged Andy to come away.</p>
  <p>He patted the boy on the head, nodded to him, and came.</p>
  <p>
    As we walked he spoke in a low voice as if to himself, telling how he had
    rescued the boy from the janissaries at the time of the capture of the
    kasbah, and given him into the care of the grooms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thrusting his hand into his wallet he drew out a handful of dirty little
    pebbles like the one the boy had given me.
  </p>
  <p>They were about the size of a finger tip.</p>
  <p>Showing them to me he remarked, “He’s not ungrateful.</p>
  <p>
    Every time I bring him food he gives me one of these, and he will give me as
    many as I like for really shiny aspers.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I now began to feel grave fears for Andy’s reason, and said, “Dear Andy,
    you must have a touch of the sun!
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t mean you exchange silver aspers for the rubbish that boy gives
    you, and keep it in your purse?
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I was about to throw away the stone that I’d been given, as the fowl
    droppings that stuck to it dirtied my fingers.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Andy held my arm urgently and said, “Spit on the stone and rub it on
    your sleeve!
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I had no wish to soil my fine kaftan, yet I did as he asked, and when I
    had rubbed the stone it began to shine like a piece of polished glass.
  </p>
  <p>
    A queer thrill ran through me, though I dared not believe I held a jewel in
    my hand.
  </p>
  <p>One of that size would have been worth many thousand ducats.</p>
  <p>“Just a piece of glass,” I said doubtfully.</p>
  <p>“So I thought.</p>
  <p>
    But I happened to show the smallest of these stones to a trustworthy Jew in
    the bazaar, and he at once offered me fifty ducats for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This showed me that it was worth at least five hundred, and I put it away
    again.
  </p>
  <p>
    I laugh sometimes to think what an enormous fortune is rattling about in my
    purse.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I still found it hard to believe him until suddenly I remembered the boy’s
    red velvet cap.
  </p>
  <p>I clapped my hand to my forehead and cried, “Allah is indeed merciful!</p>
  <p>
    That idiot boy no doubt had time to ransack the empty rooms of the kasbah
    before it was captured, and found Muley-Hassan’s velvet bag which he left
    behind in his haste.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” I told Andy what the Jewish merchant in Istanbul had confided to me, and
    suggested that we should return to the boy at once and get the rest of the
    two hundred from him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Andy said, “It won’t do, for the boy never parts with more than one or two
    at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    He’s as cunning as a fox, for all his idiocy, and though I’ve spied upon him
    once or twice I have never been able to find his hiding place.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” “The matter is somewhat complicated,” I said, “and must be carefully
    considered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The diamonds being Muley-Hassan’s property form part of Khaireddin’s spoils
    of war; that’s to say they belong to the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should get little reward for finding them; indeed they would only seek to
    extort the rest of the two hundred stones and suspect us of dishonesty if we
    were simple enough to hand over no more than those that by the grace of
    Allah have fallen into our hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet we should be mad to leave the rest of this great fortune lying in the
    dirt.
  </p>
  <p>” Such was also Andy’s opinion.</p>
  <p>
    We dared not breathe a word to anyone of our discovery, but postponed our
    journey from day to day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time we visited the boy he gave us two or three stones, for which we
    dared not offer more than one asper each, lest the sums he received should
    attract attention.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I spoke to the Imam of Jamin’s mosque and left with him a sum
    sufficient for the support and schooling of the boy.
  </p>
  <p>
    If his intellect proved inadequate for reading and writing he was to be
    trained in some handicraft by which he could earn his living.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of June, when we had collected one hundred and ninetyseven
    stones, the boy sadly showed us his empty hands, and though we visited him
    several times afterward, pleading and threatening, it was clear that either
    he had lost the three remaining stones or that Muley- Hassan had counted
    them wrongly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We then washed the boy, dressed him in good clothes, and led him to the Imam
    of the mosque, though he struggled and resisted with all his strength and
    would not be quieted even by Andy’s kindly words.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having thus salved our consciences we bade a hasty farewell to Abu el-Kasim,
    meaning to make for the harbor and take ship for Istanbul.
  </p>
  <p>
    A distant boom froze us to the spot, and soon flocks of terrified fugitives
    were streaming into the city shrieking that the Emperor’s fleet had appeared
    before the fortress of La Goletta.
  </p>
  <p>
    The harbor was thus blockaded, and under cover of the unceasing cannonade
    the Spaniards landed many troops.
  </p>
  <p>My own greed had trapped me.</p>
  <p>
    I blamed myself bitterly for not having been content with fewer stones, so
    that I might have sailed from Tunis while there was yet time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was small comfort to learn that the Emperor had arrived at least a
    fortnight before he was expected, and now held the greater part of
    Khaireddin’s fleet trapped and helpless within the blockaded harbor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only fifteen of his lightest galleys were able to seek shelter at other
    points along the coast.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hastened to La Goletta to discover how true these reports were, and
    whether we might yet run the blockade in one of Khaireddin’s vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
    But from the tower we beheld the enemy fleet of not less than three hundred
    sail spread over the waters as far as the eye could see.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only a cannon-shot away, a large group of German pikemen were pouring
    ashore, and these at once began to throw up ramparts and palisades to
    protect their beachhead.
  </p>
  <p>
    To prevent Khaireddin’s fleet from breaking out, the great galleys of the
    Knights of St.
  </p>
  <p>
    John lay in the forefront; behind them I beheld the terrible carrack that
    like a floating hill rose high above the other vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
    From its four rows of gaping gun ports protruded the dark mouth of cannon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doria’s slender war galleys, the sturdy caravels of g y y Portugal, and
    Neapolitan galleasses covered the calm surface of the sea, and in the midst
    of them all rode the Emperor’s mighty flagship with its four banks of oars
    and its gilded pavilion gleaming on the high poop deck.
  </p>
  <p>
    To Khaireddin’s credit be it said that the hour of danger brought out the
    best in him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forgotten was his empty boasting; his bearing was assured, he drew in his
    belly, and in thunderous tones issued the necessary orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    The command of the Goletta fortress he entrusted to Sinan the Jew with six
    thousand picked janissaries— almost too large a garrison to be crammed into
    tower and fortifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    He sent Arabian and Moorish cavalry to oppose the landings and gain time.
  </p>
  <p>
    They could not prevent them, but they could at least keep the Imperial
    troops on the defensive both day and night.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not until the camp had been strongly fortified did the invaders mount their
    guns and open the bombardment of La Goletta, and after this the cavalry
    dared not venture within range.
  </p>
  <p>
    And now the incessant, appalling din of artillery fire made life within the
    fort so unendurable that I left Andy on the battlements to watch with joyful
    wonder the progress of the conflict, and returned in deep dejection to
    Tunis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Retreat by land was unthinkable, for the wild Berbers, whose hostility
    Khaireddin had aroused, controlled the roads and robbed all who sought to
    flee from the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    Muley-Hassan himself was not far away, though like a cautious man he had not
    yet joined the Imperial troops, despite his promises.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Charles had no need of his help, for his own army consisted of thirty
    thousand seasoned German, Spanish, and Italian mercenaries, and his
    artillery kept the area about La Goletta under continuous and accurate fire,
    so that many of Sinan’s Turkish janissaries were daily carried up the short
    way to Paradise.
  </p>
  <p>
    And every day fresh vessels brought warriors from all over Christendom to
    join the Emperor and in his sight win imperishable glory in the fight
    against the infidel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three weeks of savage warfare ensued, and despite the courage and religious
    zeal of the Moslem defenders only Abu el-Kasim refused to believe that Allah
    would give Christians the victory and through them bring Muley-Hassan back
    to power.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so I saw how even a shrewd, cunning man like Abu could be so blinded by
    happiness that for the sake of his wife and son he believed to the last only
    what he wished to believe.
  </p>
  <p>La Goletta held out for a month, and this in itself was a miracle.</p>
  <p>Then the walls began to crumble, and the towers fell.</p>
  <p>
    When at last the Emperor ordered the general assault, Doria’s vessels rowed
    past the fortress in line, firing off their pieces as they went.
  </p>
  <p>The huge carrack of the Knights of St.</p>
  <p>John anchored near the shore and fired g unceasingly over the galleys.</p>
  <p>
    Then Sinan the Jew submitted to the will of Allah and blew all Khaireddin’s
    irreplaceable fleet out of the water, sending a vast column of smoke into
    the air and setting crockery clattering in the distant city.
  </p>
  <p>The assault was launched from two directions at once.</p>
  <p>The Knights of St.</p>
  <p>
    John charged in from the sea, up to the waist in water, and when they and
    the Spaniards took possession of the fortress Sinan the Jew issued his last
    command—each man for himself!
  </p>
  <p>
    To set a good example he flung himself out across the salt marsh that
    surrounded the stronghold, having already prospected and marked a safe path
    across the swamps by which the survivors could reach the shelter of the
    city.
  </p>
  <p>
    The muddy, bleeding little party staggered up to the gates of Tunis that
    evening, but at the tips of the staves to which the horsehair switches were
    attached Khaireddin’s silver crescents still gleamed, in token of the
    deathless honor won that day by the defenders of La Goletta.
  </p>
  <p>Panic now seized the inhabitants of Tunis.</p>
  <p>
    All roads leading from the city were soon packed with fugitives carrying
    bundles and dragging loads in a blind rush to get as far away as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would of course have joined them had not common sense told me that all
    would soon fall a prey to Muley-Hassan’s roving horsemen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately the Imperial troops had suffered so severely that for many days
    they rested in their camp to lick their wounds, and meanwhile Khaireddin
    with flattery, prayers, and threats contrived to calm the worst of the panic
    before summoning his captains, the most eminent men of Tunis, and also the
    leaders of his Arab allies to a ceremonial Divan in the great hall of the
    kasbah.
  </p>
  <p>
    He spoke to them like a father, and as only he could speak when occasion
    demanded.
  </p>
  <p>
    His plan was to march out of the city and in the time-honored Moslem fashion
    offer the Emperor a pitched battle in the open.
  </p>
  <p>
    And indeed this scheme was less crazy than I at first believed, though I
    admit I listened in openmouthed wonder at his valor.
  </p>
  <p>
    So persuasively did he speak that Abu first among them all rolled up his
    sleeves, brandished his scimitar, and yelled that for the sake of his wife
    and son he meant to seek the road to Paradise.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is even possible that this behavior was not prearranged, for Khaireddin
    himself looked surprised.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eminent Tunisian gentlemen joined a little dubiously in the bloodthirsty
    shouts, and a spark of hope was kindled in my own dejected heart, since I am
    prone to believe whatever is told me with sufficient emphasis—especially if
    it is something I hope for.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when the greater number of the audience left the kasbah, Khaireddin
    gathered about him the trustiest of his raises for a nocturnal conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not even Abu el-Kasim was invited, though g Andy and I were allowed to
    attend on condition of secrecy.
  </p>
  <p>This time Khaireddin spoke in a different tone.</p>
  <p>
    He stroked his beard vigorously, his face was grave, and he did not even
    feign confidence in the outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Only a miracle from Allah can save us,” he said, “and experience has taught
    me not to expect miracles in warfare.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must seek a pitched battle, for the ruinous city walls would collapse
    under bombardment and the treacherous inhabitants would sooner stab us in
    the back than fight against the Emperor.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time we must keep an eye upon the Christian slaves packed in the
    cellars beneath our feet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor do I trust the Arab horsemen, for as soon as they’re fired on with
    cannon and harquebus they will scatter like chaff before the wind.
  </p>
  <p>Allah’s will be done.</p>
  <p>
    Let us try our luck in pitched battle rather than seek safety in shameful
    flight, which in any case presents its own difficulties.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” He shook his head, glanced about him sourly, and went on, “The first
    essential is to get rid of the Christian prisoners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many are fit to bear arms—even to ride—and one traitor among us is enough to
    prevent our return to the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am no cruel man, as you know, but these prisoners number eighteen or
    twenty thousand, and for the sake of our own lives we must set to work
    immediately if all are to be strangled before sundown.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us console ourselves for the financial loss involved by the thought that
    when Allah turns the leaves of his great book on the Last Day, the slaying
    of these unbelievers will be accounted to us for merit.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” But at this even the most loyal captains looked askance at one another,
    and Sinan, who had invested his whole fortune in Christian slaves and made
    good money by hiring them out, fingered his sparse beard and exclaimed, “Not
    my worst enemy could call me sentimental, but so cruel a deed would forever
    sully our name and fame in every country in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Christians would avenge their death on those Moslems who sigh in their
    dungeons, and my stomach turns over at the thought of the loss that would be
    caused us by so hasty an action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us rather stack powder barrels beneath the vaults so that if the worst
    happens we can blow up the whole kasbah; for if Allah should give us the
    victory, how damped would our rejoicings be by any needless loss!
  </p>
  <p>” His cautious plan prevailed.</p>
  <p>
    When early next morning the Emperor’s forces marched from their camp, we
    left the city to resume our battle with the most experienced and seasoned
    troops of Christendom.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this Khaireddin acted more courageously than did the Sultan and Grand
    Vizier in Hungary, though it must be admitted that he had no choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once drawn up in order of battle on the plains, our numbers seemed far from
    contemptible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The white-clad Arab horsemen p covered the slopes of the low hills and the
    brave inhabitants of Tunis, driven from the city with whips, had armed
    themselves with cleavers and carving knives, since Khaireddin after the loss
    of his arsenal in La Goletta could give them nothing better.
  </p>
  <p>
    In numbers, at least, we were nearly equal to the Imperial troops, though
    not quite ninety thousand as the Emperor’s historians afterward reported to
    enhance their sovereign’s glory.
  </p>
  <p>I followed Andy’s cannon, armed with a light musket and a scimitar.</p>
  <p>
    It was not from ambition or love of fighting that I marched with the rest,
    but simply because I felt safer among Khaireddin’s janissaries and renegades
    than in the turbulent city.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the battle lasted little longer than the prayer of one girt for a
    journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Imperial infantry advanced in squares, the Arab riders poured down
    the slopes in scattered groups and with wild howls discharged a rain of
    arrows into the enemy ranks.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the answering artillery fire veiled the yellow battlefield in clouds of
    smoke, and with even wilder yells the Arabs scattered like chaff.
  </p>
  <p>
    They caught up in their flight the bold defenders of Tunis and swept back
    into the city more swiftly than they had come.
  </p>
  <p>Meanwhile we discharged our cannon.</p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin, mounted on his champing steed, noticed that he was now somewhat
    solitary on that wide field; there were but four hundred or so renegades
    about him, while thirty thousand well-trained Imperial soldiers were
    steadily advancing, to say nothing of cannon and muskets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this most perilous moment of his life the lord of the sea kept his wits
    about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calling to Allah for help in a voice of thunder, he then exhorted his men to
    deserve Paradise and hold up the enemy by resolute fighting, while he sought
    to persuade the fugitives to return.
  </p>
  <p>
    He then set spurs to his horse and galloped so speedily back to the city
    that many of those he pursued fell beneath his horse’s hoofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To us who remained fell the honor of gallantly engaging the whole Imperial
    army, firing off our cannon once more and shoulder to shoulder defending
    ourselves against the advancing Germans and Spaniards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our only hope of safety lay in keeping close order and retiring step by step
    on the city, since unlike Khaireddin we had no horses at our disposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    When at last, bleeding and exhausted, we reached the city we found battle
    raging in the streets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inhabitants hurled themselves upon the Turks and renegades and from the
    housetops showered down stones, pots, cauldrons, and whatever else they
    could lay hands on.
  </p>
  <p>
    They screeched that they would throw off the yoke of the High Porte and
    greet Muley-Hassan with rejoicing as their deliverer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the white flag was run up on the kasbah, and when Khaireddin sought to
    enter it and save his treasure he found the gates barred, while the
    Christian slaves who had freed themselves of their shackles greeted him with
    a hail of stones from the walls, wounding him in head and jaw.
  </p>
  <p>
    What wonder then that before the gates of the kasbah Khaireddin lost all
    control of himself, ground his teeth, and yelled between foaming lips, “All
    is lost!
  </p>
  <p>
    The dogs of unbelievers have captured the citadel and stolen my treasure!
  </p>
  <p>” Terror overwhelmed me when I saw that all was indeed lost.</p>
  <p>
    I tried to run after Khaireddin’s horse and hang onto its tail, but my only
    reward was a kick in the stomach.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a howl of agony I writhed on the ground clutching my belly until Andy
    dragged me to my feet and led me away, cutting a path through the mob with
    his sword.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Arab horsemen saw that the battle was lost and that Khaireddin had
    fled, they quickly tore up their treaty with him and galloped off toward the
    Imperial army, each striving to be the first to pay homage to Muley-Hussan
    and seek the Emperor’s protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their eager yells of peace so alarmed the Spaniards that they drove their
    rests into the ground again and fired their harquebuses into the advancing
    hordes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many hundred Arabs lost their lives, or at least their splendid horses,
    before the unfortunate mistake was discovered.
  </p>
  <p>Was this perhaps the judgment of Allah upon them for their treachery?</p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, the inhabitants broke off palm branches and stripped the trees in
    their gardens so as to hail in time-honored fashion the victorious
    Muley-Hassan and the Emperor, who entered Tunis in his company.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were therefore utterly dismayed when Germans, Italians, and Spaniards
    with sword in hand poured in to win salvation by murdering every Moslem they
    could lay hands on, and to plunder the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sack of Tunis continued for three days, and I have been told that in the
    course of it no fewer than one hundred thousand Moslems were slain, whether
    they belonged to Muley-Hassan’s party or to Khaireddin’s.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I have run ahead of events, and must relate what happened after
    Khaireddin had fled from the gates of the kasbah.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loyally followed by Sinan the Jew and other bold captains, he made off so
    swiftly as to abandon the horsetail switches in the street.
  </p>
  <p>Here it was that Andy seized an Arab horse by the bridle, threw of?</p>
  <p>
    the rider, and pushed me up in his place, so that I found myself very
    suddenly clinging to the saddle of a shying steed and fumbling frantically
    for the reins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Andy roared at me to ride to Abu el-Kasim’s house where he would join me as
    soon as he had collected enough horses.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I left I saw him snatch up Khaireddin’s standard, roaring to janissaries
    and Mussulmans to rally to the Crescent.
  </p>
  <p>
    I rode to Abu el-Kasim’s house, protecting my head as best I might from the
    missiles hurled from the roofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when at last I arrived I found Abu lying naked and senseless before his
    gate.
  </p>
  <p>His forehead was smashed in and his beard bloody.</p>
  <p>
    Round about him lay a quantity of valuables that had fallen from his bundle,
    and men were kicking and spitting on his body and reviling him as one of
    Khaireddin’s spies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I rode straight at them being unable to control my horse, calling upon all
    the faithful to help me, and they scattered like hens, in the belief that
    Khaireddin’s mamelukes were at my heels.
  </p>
  <p>
    I threw myself from the saddle and tethered my quivering, lathered steed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the courtyard I saw Abu el-Kasim’s wife lying ripped up in her own blood,
    but even in death she strove to protect her child in her broad bosom.
  </p>
  <p>His head was so battered as to be unrecognizable.</p>
  <p>
    I knelt quickly beside my friend Abu el-Kasim and poured a little water over
    his waxen face.
  </p>
  <p>
    He opened his weary monkey eyes for the last time and said in a broken
    voice, “Ah, Michael!
  </p>
  <p>Life is nothing but one great dunghill.</p>
  <p>
    This thought is all I can bequeath you in the hour of my death, for the
    rabble have stolen my purse.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The veil dropped over his eyes and on dark wings came that One who severs
    the bonds of friendship, silences song, and reveals the vanity of human
    happiness and grief.
  </p>
  <p>I sat on the ground beside his dead body and wept bitterly.</p>
  <p>
    Just then Andy rode into the courtyard, followed by a few men who had
    remained loyal to Khaireddin.
  </p>
  <p>Rising hastily I shouted, “Dear brother Andy, we’re lost!</p>
  <p>
    Nothing is left but to seek the Emperor’s protection, and if the worst comes
    to the worst we can deny our Moslem faith, since fortunately we were never
    circumcised.
  </p>
  <p>
    My faith in the Prophet has today suffered so hard a blow that it can
    scarcely recover.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” But Andy brandished Khaireddin’s horsetail standard above his head and in
    a loud voice cursed all unbelievers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then quietly he said to me, “Do you really fancy that the Spaniards and
    Germans would show mercy to renegades?
  </p>
  <p>
    Jump into your saddle, Michael, and fight like a man so that we may catch up
    with Khaireddin at Bona, before he has time to hoist sail and escape to sea
    without us!
  </p>
  <p>Believe me, this is our only hope.</p>
  <p>
    ” He was battle mad, and his gray eyes rolled so wildly in his powder-
    blackened face that I could not oppose him.
  </p>
  <p>
    We rode into the street and thanks to the disorder wrought by the Christian
    slaves we were able to leave the city without violence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We passed countless plundered fugitives who wrung their hands and blindly
    sought refuge in the desert where the best they could hope for was death
    from thirst, for the hottest season of the year was now upon us.
  </p>
  <p>
    At length our exhausted horses brought us to Tagaste where Augustine, the
    great Father of the Church, was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    At that time, however, I did not stop the meditate upon this, but with
    sun-dazzled eyes looked eagerly for p p y g y Khaireddin’s galleys in the
    harbor.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were just rowing out to sea, but our musket shots and despairing cries
    induced Khaireddin to send back a boat for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    He greeted us with tears and embraced us like a father, assuring us of his
    uneasiness on our account.
  </p>
  <p>But I slid senseless to the deck, worn out with my exertions.</p>
  <p>
    Next morning the skin peeled from my face, and my limbs felt as if they had
    been crushed.
  </p>
  <p>But Khaireddin comforted me, saying, “Allah’s will be done!</p>
  <p>
    I dare not return to the Sultan with the fragments of the greatest Ottoman
    fleet that ever sailed the sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    I shall therefore make for Algiers and remain there until he has had time to
    calm himself.
  </p>
  <p>I’m a poor man now and must begin again from the beginning.</p>
  <p>I see that my proper place is at sea, not ashore.</p>
  <p>
    My friends must speak for me at the Divan, if I still have any friends
    there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will be prudent and stay away from the High Porte, and this time gladly
    leave the talking to others.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” Thus the irrepressible Khaireddin began already to form new plans, though
    we were not yet out of danger and the Emperor had sent his swiftest galleys
    in pursuit of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin’s escape threatened to snatch the fruits of victory from
    Charles’s hands, for dominion of the sea was the Emperor’s main object; the
    restoration of Muley-Hassan to the throne of Tunis was a matter of complete
    indifference to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Khaireddin easily shook off his pursuers and we arrived safely in
    Algiers, whence he instantly dispatched every seaworthy craft to capture
    unprotected Christian merchantmen and at the same time to spread fire and
    devastation along the Italian and Sardinian coasts.
  </p>
  <p>
    These raids were well timed, for victory peals were ringing in every
    village, and Christian congregations flocked into the churches to sing the
    Te Deum in thanksgiving for Khaireddin’s defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the third day the Emperor commanded that the looting of Tunis should
    cease and order be restored in the ravaged city, to allow Muley- Hassan to
    ascend to the throne of his fathers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way the Emperor sought to show how selfless had been his part in the
    war, which he had embarked upon merely as a favor to a prince who had begged
    his help.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have felt it necessary to record the events of this Tunisian crusade,
    which historians and poets have celebrated and eminent painters immortalized
    in many pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    By leading the enterprise in person and exposing himself to countless
    dangers, the Emperor won the admiration of all Christendom.
  </p>
  <p>
    Poets referred to him as the first chevalier of Europe, to the fury of King
    Francis I.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the true object was never attained, for the summer had not ended before
    Khaireddin and his captains had given convincing proof of their continued
    life and vigor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Emperor’s efforts to annihilate Moslem sea power had been in vain and
    exceedingly expensive —a circumstance passed over in silence by the
    historians.
  </p>
  <p>
    I willingly confess that I was in no hurry to return to Istanbul, and stayed
    for some time in Algiers as the guest of Khaireddin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not until just before the onset of the winter gales did I venture upon the
    long voyage home.
  </p>
  <p>The arsenal guns fired no acknowledgment of our salute.</p>
  <p>
    The Sultan and the Grand Vizier had not yet returned from the Persian
    campaign, which was of course a great relief to me, and having handed
    Khaireddin’s letter to a court official who hurried to meet us at the quay,
    Andy and I took a boat straight to my house, where I might hide my shame
    away from the gloating stares of the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giulia received me with a pale face and swollen eyes, and reproached me
    bitterly for neither writing to her nor sending her money.
  </p>
  <p>Yet when she perceived my exhaustion and grief she let me be.</p>
  <p>
    It is no easy thing even for a mature and hardened man to watch high hopes
    go up in smoke and to witness the death of a good friend.
  </p>
  <p>
    She promised to forgive me, therefore, and spoke with malicious pleasure of
    the Sultan’s army, which after three months of campaigning had recaptured
    Tabriz and remained there for weeks in the vain attempt to lure Shah Tahmasp
    into decisive conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultan had liberally distributed provinces and cities to distinguished
    Persians who made submission to him, and when his forces began to run short
    of food he had started on the homeward march.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as they left first one and then another of the Persian lands behind
    them, the Shah’s forces recaptured them and inflicted severe losses on the
    Ottoman rear guard.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Shiite heretics rejoiced and purified their mosques from Sunnite
    pollution; so the great Persian campaign petered out.
  </p>
  <p>“But,” said Giulia, “the Sultan is in no way to blame for the defeat.</p>
  <p>
    The culprits are the bad advisers who enticed him on this questionable
    enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>It is high time the Sultan realized Ibrahim’s uselessness as a general.</p>
  <p>
    The Mufti is enraged because he protected the Shiite heretics and forbade
    the plundering of Persian cities, despite the fatwa prepared for the
    purpose.
  </p>
  <p>” I answered sorrowfully, “While the cat’s away the mice will play.</p>
  <p>
    I shall not abate my loyalty to the Grand Vizier just because he has
    suffered defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now more than ever does he need a friend’s support, and I’ll merely remind
    you of the old proverb, he laughs best who laughs last.
  </p>
  <p>” “I shall laugh, never fear!</p>
  <p>Expect no sympathy from me if you choose to ruin yourself.</p>
  <p>But there’s still time.</p>
  <p>
    I have spoken to Khurrem on your behalf and she is willing to forgive you,
    for the sake of Prince Jehangir.
  </p>
  <p>
    I may tell you in confidence that she does not blame Khaireddin for his
    defeat and is ready to put in a word for him too if you humbly ask it of
    her.
  </p>
  <p>Such is the honesty of this good and devout lady.</p>
  <p>
    ” I suspected deceit, having learned to mistrust everyone and especially
    Giulia.
  </p>
  <p>
    But next day Sultana Khurrem sent her pleasure barge to fetch me to the
    Seraglio, where she received me in her own porphyry chamber in the Court of
    Bliss.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first she spoke from behind a curtain, but later she drew it aside and
    revealed her face to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her immodest behavior showed how customs here had changed in a few years.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time when I became the Sultan’s slave certain death awaited every man
    who beheld a woman of the harem unveiled, even by accident.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sultana spoke to me in a playful, teasing tone and gurgled with laughter
    as if someone were tickling her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet her eyes were cold and hard, and at length she ordered me to tell her
    openly and without reserve all that I had seen and done in Tunis and what
    had happened afterward.
  </p>
  <p>
    I at once admitted Khaireddin’s reverses, but in his defense went on to
    speak of his success in the later part of the summer, and assured her that
    with my own eyes I had seen eighteen big galleys under construction at
    Algiers, so that by the spring Khaireddin’s fleet would be ready to rule the
    seas once more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khurrem held her head a little sideways as she listened, and a smile played
    continually over her beautiful lips.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seemed to me that she was paying more attention to my appearance than to
    what I was saying, and at last she remarked absently, “Khaireddin Barbarossa
    is a devout and valiant man and a faithful servant of the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Prophet himself appears to him in dreams and when he shakes his long
    beard he looks like a lion with a luxuriant mane.
  </p>
  <p>
    He needs no one to speak in his defense, for I know best how to win my
    lord’s favor for him.
  </p>
  <p>But still you have not told me everything, Michael elHakim.</p>
  <p>Why did you go to Tunis in the first place?</p>
  <p>
    And what message was it that the malignant Grand Vizier sent by you to
    Khaireddin and dared not put into writing?
  </p>
  <p>” I stared at her, disconcerted, unable to guess at her meaning.</p>
  <p>Then I licked my lips and mumbled something.</p>
  <p>She encouraged me laughingly, “Michael el-Hakim, you’re a great rogue.</p>
  <p>
    Confess honestly that Seraskier Ibrahim sent you to Tunis to inquire
    secretly whether Khaireddin would acknowledge the Grand Vizier’s title of
    Seraskier-sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    If he said yes, you were to bid him to take his fleet to the Sea of Marmara
    and await further orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Emperor’s unexpected attack foiled these ugly schemes and Khaireddin
    was saved from making a negative reply, which would have brought down upon
    him the Grand Vizier’s wrath.
  </p>
  <p>” “Allah is Allah!</p>
  <p>” I exclaimed in dismay.</p>
  <p>“That is nonsense—base lies from beginning to end.</p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier sent me to warn Khaireddin against the Emperor’s false
    promises, for Charles had offered to make him king of Africa.
  </p>
  <p>” “Quite so,” assented Khurrem hastily.</p>
  <p>
    “Then the Grand Vizier ordered you to tell Khaireddin that it lay in his
    power to make him king of Africa with the right to appoint his own heirs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then with the Emperor as ruler of Europe and the Seraskier-sultan as ruler
    of Asia, Khaireddin would take his place as the third of the world’s
    sovereigns.
  </p>
  <p>” “What do you mean by that foolish title Seraskier-sultan?</p>
  <p>” I demanded, so exasperated that I forgot my lowly position.</p>
  <p>“You turn everything upsidedown.</p>
  <p>
    I had no such mission and my only object has been to serve the Sultan
    loyally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Neither Khaireddin nor I can be blamed for the defeat and I have nothing to
    add, since you will persist in distorting the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The smile faded from the Sultana’s lips and her plump face became a chalky
    mask.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her eyes took on an icy blue glint, and for a moment I seemed to be face to
    face with a monster in human form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet this singular expression vanished so quickly that I fancied I must have
    dreamed it or been bewitched by her look.
  </p>
  <p>
    Presently she said in her usual cooing tones, “Perhaps you are speaking the
    truth and my informant was mistaken.
  </p>
  <p>I can only rejoice that all serve the Sultan so loyally and faithfully.</p>
  <p>
    You have greatly relieved my mind, Michael el-Hakim; you deserve liberal
    reward, and I shall not forget to put in a good word for you with the
    Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps I am foolish to imagine that so gifted a man as the Grand Vizier
    would do anything behind his lord’s back.
  </p>
  <p>We must wait and see.</p>
  <p>
    All will turn out for the best and you and I will be silent about the whole
    distressing affair.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” She smiled at me again in her bewitching manner, but the cold glint
    remained in her eye as she repeated the words that seemed to veil a stern
    warning: “All will turn out for the best, and you and I will be silent about
    the whole distressing affair.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” With this she made a sign with her plump hand and a slave girl dropped the
    curtain between us.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I returned through the splendid courtyards of the Seraglio I was overcome
    by a sense of unreality.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was like a story, or a dream, and I seemed to have been through it all
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at the countless slaves who from the highest to the lowest turned
    their backs on me, and they no longer appeared to me as living people.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was as if they had no faces of their own, and only by their clothes,
    headdresses, sticks, whips, ladles, and other tokens of rank could I tell
    their position and occupation.
  </p>
  <p>They looked like nothing so much as brilliant beetles.</p>
  <p>
    Any one of them could have changed places with any other without altering
    the pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    All would go on in the same empty way and with the same senseless and
    outmoded customs as before.
  </p>
  <p>I seemed tQ stand outside.</p>
  <p>I no longer brooded over myself or my fate.</p>
  <p>
    I felt only an unspeakable weariness and depression, and the vanity of it
    all was like a raw December day in my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the beginning of January, 1536, Sultan Suleiman arrived at Scutari on the
    opposite shore of the Marmara, and allowed members of the Divan to help him
    from the saddle as a sign that the Persian campaign was at an end.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grand Vizier had secretly ordered the p g y building of a splendid
    barge, well able to compare with the fabled “Bucentoro” of the Doge of
    Venice, so that in a manner worthy of the conquerer of Persia the Sultan
    might glide over to Istanbul amid the thunder of salutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once more the names of captured fortresses and cities were proclaimed to the
    populace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once more the bonfires blazed for nights on end and the people roared their
    acclamations of the returning spahis and janissaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    But this time the joy was forced, as if evil forebodings had poisoned the
    mood of triumph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the army had suffered very severe losses on the retreat, on
    account of both the Persian cavalry attacks and the bad weather, and many
    wives bitterly mourned their dead husbands, though they might do this only
    in solitude and within the four walls of their homes.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the days of jubilation, life in the capital resumed its normal course,
    and no foreigner would have noticed any change.
  </p>
  <p>
    King Francis I’s representative, who had attended the Sultan from Bagdad to
    Tabriz and back to Istanbul, was rewarded for his trouble by the Sultan’s
    consent to a commercial treaty with France.
  </p>
  <p>
    Slaves of French birth in the Sultan’s dominions were given their freedom
    and all things pointed to the fact that King Francis, having learned nothing
    from former failures, was preparing for another war against the Emperor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Khaireddin did not fall into disgrace as many had hoped; on the contrary,
    the treaty was drawn up in his name and he was designated therein as king of
    Algeria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without this, ill feeling would have been aroused among both Moslems and
    Christians.
  </p>
  <p>
    As it was, many otherwise shrewd Moslems blamed the Grand Vizier for
    secretly favoring the Christians, just as he had been blamed for protecting
    the Shiite heretics at the Ottoman army’s expense.
  </p>
  <p>
    But by this time all evil that occurred was laid at his door, to blacken his
    face and undermine his position, while all good was credited to the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the course of that spring the people’s senseless and unreasoning hatred
    for the Grand Vizier became so evident that he preferred not to appear in
    public, and remained either in his palace beyond the Atmeidan or among the
    buildings of the third courtyard of the Seraglio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Janissaries exercising on the Atmeidan would yell insults and make faces at
    his palace, and one night some drunken wrestlers broke into it, tore the
    trophies from the walls and smashed them, and befouled the corners of his
    rooms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet to avoid all troublesome publicity the Grand Vizier made no inquiry and
    summoned none of the culprits to answer for the outrage.
  </p>
  <p>
    After his return from Persia the Grand Vizier was compelled first of all to
    deal with matters that had arisen during his absence and that the pashas had
    refused to handle for fear of making mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Negotiations in preparation for the French treaty also occupied his g p p y
    p time, so that with the best will in the world he could not receive me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The winter days went by without hope of a personal interview, although I
    longed to warn him of dangers that I did not dare to hint at in a letter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now and then he sent me word that he would attend to me all in good time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In response to my continual pestering, the Grand Vizier sent me two hundred
    gold pieces in a silken bag.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was intended as a proof of his favor, but never did a present sadden
    and hurt me so much.
  </p>
  <p>
    It showed that in his heart he despised me and believed that I served him
    only for money—and how could I blame him for that?
  </p>
  <p>The fault was mine.</p>
  <p>Too long I had thought only of presents and rewards.</p>
  <p>
    But now as I stood idly among the slender pillars of the Grand Vizier’s
    entrance hall with that embroidered purse in my hand, I perceived with
    agonizing clarity that not all the gold in the world could deaden the pain
    now gnawing at my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet I will not seek to appear better than I am, for my object in writing
    this story is to be as honest as it is possible for imperfect human nature
    to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore I admit freely that since sharing the Tunisian diamonds with Andy
    I felt—though without any great pleasure—that my future was financially
    secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    On my return Giulia laid her white arms about my neck and said coaxingly,
    “Dear Michael, while you were out I searched your medicine chest for a
    remedy for stomach trouble.
  </p>
  <p>The Greek gardener is ill.</p>
  <p>
    But I dared not take the African drug that you brought from Tunis, for you
    told me that an overdose might be dangerous.
  </p>
  <p>I don’t want to harm the man through ignorance.</p>
  <p>
    ” I disliked her habit of ransacking my chests while I was out, and I told
    her so.
  </p>
  <p>
    But my mind was on other things and I gave her a drug that Abu el-Kasim had
    warmly recommended, warning her against administering too much at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same evening I was attacked by pains in the stomach after eating fruit,
    and Giulia told me that besides the gardener, one of the boatmen had also
    fallen sick.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such disorders were common in Istanbul and I paid no heed to my own pains.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took a dose of aloes and opium before going to bed and in the morning was
    fully recovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next day I learned that the Sultan had suffered the same thing after an
    evening meal taken with the Grand Vizier.
  </p>

    Suleiman at once succumbed to a mood of depression—a common enough thing
    among those suffering from stomach disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result of the Sultan’s sickness the Grand Vizier at last had his
    evenings to himself, and at sunset after the prayer he sent for me.

  <p>
    I hastened at once to his palace, but that lovely building, usually
    brilliant with countless lamps and surrounded by crowds, now stood dark,
    empty, and silent, like a house of mourning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only a few pale slaves stood idly in the great hall, which was lit by a few
    faintly y g y y burning lamps, but between the slender columns of the
    audience chamber the German clockmaker came hurrying toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
    With him, to my surprise, was the Sultan’s French clockmaker, whom King
    Francis had sent to Suleiman after hearing of his weakness for clocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both these masters were examining with solemn physicians’ airs the unevenly
    ticking clock, made by Niimberg’s most famous horologist, that should have
    indicated unerringly the hour, date, month, year, and even the position of
    the planets.

    The German fell on his knees, kissed my hand, and said, “Ah, Master Michael,
    I am lost—I have forgotten my cunning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to my skilled repairs this unlucky timepiece has gone perfectly for
    six years, and now it has begun to lose.
  </p>
  <p>
    I cannot find what is wrong, and have had to beg the excellent Master
    Francois to help me.
  </p>
  <p>
    ” The clock ticked heavily, its hand pointed to seven, and the little figure
    of the smith came out and began jerkily striking the silver belL But he
    managed only three feeble strokes, the clock resumed its uneven ticking and
    the smith, his hammer still raised to strike, turned and disappeared.

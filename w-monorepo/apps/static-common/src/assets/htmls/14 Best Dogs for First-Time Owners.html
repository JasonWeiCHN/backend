      <header>14 Best Dogs for First-Time Owners</header>
      <p>
        Choosing your first dog is both exciting and a little overwhelming.
        Maybe the pup is going to be your sole companion, a playmate for your
        kids, or a "fur baby" for you and your partner. No matter what, the type
        of dog you choose should fit your lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        While every dog is, of course, unique, generally, dogs in each breed
        have relatively predictable energy levels, sizes, looks, and grooming
        needs, which can help in determining the best dog for you. Poodles,
        Labrador retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Yorkshire terriers are
        just a few of the breeds that are well-suited to be first-time pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also a lot to learn in terms of housebreaking, setting up
        feeding routines, grooming, and general canine healthcare. Most of all,
        there's inevitably a get-to-know-you period where you and your new
        four-legged friend learn each other's personalities and behaviors. You
        don't want to come out of that period feeling that you've made the wrong
        choice of dog. Fortunately, certain breeds tend to be the best dogs for
        first-time owners, as they are more easy-going, lower maintenance, or
        less intimidating than some other breeds.
      </p>
      <h4>Breed Characteristics</h4>
      <p>
        The best breed for a first-time dog owner is the dog that matches your
        energy and attention level. If you want a dog that can go running with
        you, choose an athletic dog with endurance, such as the Labrador
        retriever. If you prefer a calm lapdog—the Cavalier King Charles spaniel
        is one such breed—then it's best to avoid high-energy dog breeds. You
        may lean toward a lower-maintenance dog breed, like the papillon, as
        your first dog, especially if you do not have time for lots of grooming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that all dogs, no matter the breed, will require good care,
        training, and veterinary care. Adult foster dogs from a rescue are often
        already house-trained and well-socialized; these can be excellent dogs
        for beginners since puppies are a lot of work, requiring socialization,
        training, and a lot of attention.
      </p>
      <h4>Bernese Mountain Dog</h4>
      <p>
        The Bernese Mountain Dog might be big, but these dogs are easy-going,
        eager to please, affectionate, and intelligent. They love a good romp
        with the kids but are also happy to spend the evening relaxing at home.
        They adapt well to just about any living situation, and while not
        aggressive, they are fairly good watchdogs and are very devoted to their
        humans. Be aware, however, that Berners shed quite a bit and do require
        regular brushing to remove loose hair.
      </p>
      <h4>Bichon Frise</h4>
      <p>
        The bichon frise is a happy-go-lucky little dog, great for families with
        children or apartment living. It looks a bit like a bouncy cotton ball.
        This breed is a great all-around companion. Bichons are relatively easy
        to train, adapt well to any lifestyle, and only need moderate daily
        exercise to be happy and healthy. You will need to dedicate the time and
        money to regular visits to the groomer. This breed's curly coat needs to
        be trimmed regularly and brushed carefully. For a lower-maintenance
        coat, keep your bichon's hair cut short.
      </p>
      <h4>Boxer</h4>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a medium-large, high-energy dog, look no further
        than the playful boxer. This loyal dog forms a close bond with family.
        And if you lead a reasonably active lifestyle, a boxer could be right
        for you. This breed needs plenty of exercise and a strong foundation of
        training. Though young boxers can be a little hyperactive, they are
        trainable and enjoy attention during training. Once trained and
        socialized, boxers can thrive in active households and often get along
        well with kids. Guardians by nature, boxers are naturally protective of
        their families, especially children. And a bonus, the boxer's grooming
        needs are low-maintenance.
      </p>
      <h4>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h4>
      <p>
        The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is a sweet, affectionate dog with a
        puppy-like appearance. Cavaliers can thrive in all kinds of households
        and tend to get along well with children of all ages. This breed is
        small and has a gentle demeanor. This dog is elegant, attentive, and
        generally quiet. The Cavalier's moderate energy level means basic daily
        exercise is typically enough to maintain health. Cavaliers are also very
        smart and respond to training well. And despite a medium-length coat,
        this dog's grooming needs are basic. Just make sure to prioritize
        regular brushing.
      </p>
      <h4>Golden Retriever</h4>
      <p>
        The golden retriever is the quintessential family dog; they are eager to
        please. Goldens are excellent with children of all ages. This
        medium-large dog is happy, loyal, affectionate, and active. The breed is
        intelligent and adaptable to thrive in most households. They also need a
        fair amount of exercise to keep them in good physical condition and
        prevent boredom. Training is essential, but not difficult. They love to
        learn and can be trained to do many things. The breed needs regular
        brushing to keep its coat free of tangles and mats.
      </p>
      <h4>Great Dane</h4>
      <p>
        Don't let the Great Dane's great size intimidate you. These oversized
        pooches are gentle giants, although they can be fierce watchdogs if they
        feel their family is endangered. As a general rule, however, Great Danes
        are easy-going dogs that enjoy playing, are highly intelligent, and are
        very affectionate with their favorite humans. A dog this large needs
        careful attention to obedience training, however, and while only
        moderate shedders, Great Danes tend to be droolers.
      </p>
      <h5>Labrador Retriever</h5>
      <p>
        The Labrador retriever is one of the most popular and recognizable
        medium-large dog breeds. Labs adapt well to most environments and are
        excellent with kids. They are intensely loyal and affectionate dogs that
        form close bonds with their families. This breed is active, playful, and
        intelligent. They thrive in active households that can provide plenty of
        exercise and training. Labs love to learn and can be trained to do
        almost anything, enjoying fetching, running, and snuggling. Fortunately,
        they only have minor grooming needs, like regular brushing to minimize
        shedding.
      </p>
      <h5>Maltese</h5>
      <p>
        It's hard to resist the adorable face and friendly nature of the
        Maltese. These dogs have beautiful silky coats that drape to the floor
        if left untrimmed, but regular haircuts can keep their coat short and
        manageable. Despite all that fur, they don't shed much but should be
        brushed daily. The Maltese is a very affectionate, happy breed that
        doesn't require excessive exercise and is content to spend time relaxing
        on your lap.
      </p>
      <h5>Mixed Breed Dogs</h5>
      <p>
        When considering the right breed for you, it's important to keep
        mixed-breed dogs in the picture. These one-of-a-kind dogs can make
        excellent companions. If you are not sure which breed is right for you,
        visit your local shelter or rescue group to meet some adorable mutts.
        Rescue workers can match you with a dog that has the traits you desire.
        Training, exercise, and grooming are necessary for all dogs, but a
        mixed-breed dog's needs will depend on its unique makeup, which you can
        discover by using a dog DNA test.
      </p>
      <h5>Papillon</h5>
      <p>
        Don't let this dog's diminutive frame fool you. This happy, friendly,
        and adaptable dog breed can do well in a variety of households. The
        papillon gets along with children, but they must be gentle. The papillon
        is a hardy little dog that enjoys a somewhat active lifestyle. This
        versatile cutie can function as a lapdog and exercise partner. The
        papillon does not need a lot of exercise but wants a chance to play and
        run around. The breed is easy to train and requires only moderate
        grooming.
      </p>
      <h5>Pomeranian</h5>
      <p>
        The Pomeranian is a dainty and sweet little lapdog. The Pom often bonds
        closest to a single owner but can still do well in families. This breed
        is better with gentle older kids but can adapt to many situations. Daily
        basic exercise is generally enough to keep your Pom happy. They need
        basic training to provide structure and boundaries. Without training,
        the breed's feisty and stubborn side may come out. Fortunately, they
        respond well to consistent, positive training and will thrive because of
        it. This dog is bright and moderately active with a big fluffy coat.
        Fortunately, its coat is not as high-maintenance as it looks. Regular
        brushing is generally all you need to keep your Pom looking good.
      </p>
      <h5>Poodle</h5>
      <p>
        The poodle is a popular, versatile dog breed that makes a wonderful
        companion. The poodle is adaptable to its environment and can do very
        well in various households, including those with children. This breed
        comes in three sizes: toy, miniature, or standard. All are intelligent
        and respond well to training. Poodles are energetic dogs that need
        plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. They need grooming regularly
        to maintain their curly, continually growing coat.
      </p>
      <h5>Shih Tzu</h5>
      <p>
        The Shih Tzu is a small dog that's big on affection. This ancient
        Chinese breed is happiest when spending time with the family, whether
        that's flopped on the couch next to you watching TV or playing with the
        kids. This isn't a breed with a high need for exercise, nor is it prone
        to excessive barking, but you will need to brush that beautiful silky
        coat at least several times each week to prevent tangles. Surprisingly,
        however, the Shih Tzu sheds very little.
      </p>
      <h5>Yorkshire Terrier</h5>
      <p>
        The Yorkshire terrier is a great starter dog for those who want a little
        lapdog. This breed is affectionate towards its owner and may even act
        protective around strangers. The Yorkie has a moderate energy level and
        only needs basic exercise. Daily walks are great for this breed. It also
        needs a solid foundation of training. Without structure, these little
        dogs can be stubborn and vocal. Train your Yorkie as you would a big
        dog, and it will help strengthen the bond between you and lay down
        boundaries. This dog has grooming needs that require attentiveness.
        Yorkies have continually growing hair that must be brushed and trimmed
        regularly. If you have the time and budget for regular groomer visits,
        it will be fairly simple to keep your Yorkie looking and feeling good.

      The Almohad Caliphate is a faction with many strengths at this time. In
      the early period, it is one of the easier factions in the game to command.
      Its troops, especially Desert Archers and Berber Camels (exclusively
      available to the Almohads), are forces that can be very useful against the
      weaker opponents encountered in early battles.

      阿尔莫哈德哈里发国在这个时期拥有许多优势。在早期，它是游戏中更容易指挥的派系之一。其部队，尤其是沙漠弓箭手和专属于阿尔莫哈德的柏柏尔骆驼，在早期战斗中对抗较弱的对手时非常有用。

      The Almohad strategic position is also fairly secure. The Caliphate may
      look as if it could be crushed on two fronts, but this is deceptive. In
      the west, there are provinces that are ripe for conquest or bribery. In
      the east, the desert gives space to retreat and absorb an attack before
      retaliating, or immediate access into Egypt, and taking Egypt could deal
      an almost-mortal blow to the Egyptians.

      阿尔莫哈德的战略位置相对安全。哈里发国看似可能在两个方向被击溃，但这实际上是个误导。在西方，有些省份可以通过征服或贿赂轻易获得；在东方，沙漠提供了退却的空间，可以承受攻击后再反击，或者直接进入埃及，征服埃及几乎能对埃及人造成致命一击。

      Coming from a nomadic desert people, the Berber tribesmen of the Almoravid
      and Almohad dynasties conquered North Africa and then, at the request of
      the Iberian Muslim princes, came to Spain to protect Islam. In the
      process, they took Spain for themselves.

      阿尔莫哈德和阿尔莫拉维德王朝的柏柏尔部落出身于游牧沙漠民族，他们征服了北非，然后应伊比利亚穆斯林王子的请求来到西班牙保护伊斯兰教。在这个过程中，他们将西班牙占为己有。

      When the Almoravids abandoned their simple lifestyle in favor of the
      comfort and luxury of sophisticated city life, the Almohads turned their
      backs on such lax and easy living, and in doing so sealed the fate of the
      Almoravids. They were overthrown.

      当阿尔莫拉维德放弃简单的生活方式，追求精致城市生活的舒适与奢华时，阿尔莫哈德却背弃了这种松懈而轻松的生活，从而注定了阿尔莫拉维德的命运。他们被推翻了。

      The Almohad Caliphate now stretches along North Africa and into Spain. The
      Khalifah's rule to date has been hard, uncompromising and very successful.
      The Almohads get little love from the Christians and Jews that they rule,
      as earlier liberal attitudes towards both groups have been abandoned, but
      this lack of loyalty has had little impact.

      阿尔莫哈德哈里发国如今横跨北非和西班牙。迄今为止，哈里发的统治严厉、不妥协且非常成功。阿尔莫哈德对基督徒和犹太人的统治缺乏爱戴，早期对这两群体的宽容态度已被放弃，但这种缺乏忠诚对统治几乎没有影响。

      The Almohads have some remarkable strengths as rulers: their military
      prowess is superb, their religiously inspired troops have few equals, and
      they feel little fear of the resurgent Christian Spanish in Castile. They
      hold down an unenthusiastic population and still manage to mount major
      military expeditions. But this unpopularity could also be a weakness -
      constant vigilance in the face of disaffected people can be tiring for any
      regime.

      阿尔莫哈德作为统治者有一些显著的优势：他们的军事才能卓越，宗教激励的部队几乎无人能敌，而且他们对复兴的基督教西班牙几乎没有畏惧。他们压制着不热情的民众，仍然能够发起大型军事远征。然而，这种不受欢迎也可能成为一个弱点——面对不满民众的持续警惕可能会让任何政权感到疲惫。

      The Caliphate's rulers are, however, better placed to carry their
      conquests further into Christian Europe than any other Islamic power. They
      stand ready to wear down Spain, if not crush it outright. A weakened
      France could then be their next target, swinging south into Italy or north
      towards the rich pickings of England's continental holdings.

      然而，哈里发国的统治者更适合将征服扩展到基督教欧洲，超过其他任何伊斯兰势力。他们准备削弱西班牙，甚至可能彻底摧毁它。一个疲弱的法国可能成为他们的下一个目标，向南侵入意大利或向北进攻英格兰的大陆领土。

      Holding off Spanish aggression, should it come, would also give them the
      chance to attack in the Mediterranean, towards Egypt and then the Holy
      Land.

      如果西班牙的侵略到来，抵御住它将使他们有机会在地中海进行攻击，进而向埃及和圣地进军。

      Sicily has been in Norman hands for almost fifty years, but history warns
      any ruler of this turbulent island against complacency. Since the fall of
      the Roman Empire, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantines, and no less than five
      Muslim houses from various parts of the Mediterranean have ruled here.
      None have held onto their possession.

      西西里岛已经在诺曼人手中近五十年，但历史警告任何统治这个动荡岛屿的人不要自满。自罗马帝国衰落以来，东哥特人、拜占庭人以及来自地中海不同地区的五个穆斯林王朝曾在此统治。没有一个成功保持其领土。

      The chief virtue of Sicily lies in its position rather than in its land or
      inherent wealth—though a gifted ruler could manage these to great
      advantage. Linking the eastern and western halves of the Mediterranean,
      and offering a short maritime route from North Africa to Italy, control of
      the island is vital to any power that seeks to have a firm grip on the
      Mediterranean world.

      西西里岛的主要优势在于其地理位置，而非土地或固有财富——尽管一位有才华的统治者可以将其有效利用。它连接了地中海的东西两半，为北非与意大利之间提供了短暂的海上航线，控制这个岛屿对任何想要在地中海世界中牢牢掌控的势力至关重要。

      It is also the perfect base from which to strike out, for an attack can go
      in almost any direction. Given its strategic importance, Sicily must look
      to its own defence first and foremost, for it cannot rely on a publicly
      peaceful stance to protect it.

      这也是一个理想的出发基地，几乎可以向任何方向发起攻击。考虑到其战略重要性，西西里必须首先关注自身的防御，因为它不能依赖表面的和平立场来保护自己。

      Southern Italy is a ripe target for expansion, and if a foothold can be
      established in North Africa, a wedge will be driven between the Islamic
      lands of the eastern and western Mediterranean, which might lead to the
      eventual weakening of Islamic power. Shipping will be vital to this
      enterprise, and a maritime trading empire among the islands of the
      Mediterranean is another worthy goal.

      南意大利是一个适合扩张的目标，如果能够在北非建立立足点，就能在东、西地中海的伊斯兰土地之间插入一个楔子，最终可能导致伊斯兰势力的削弱。航运对这一事业至关重要，在地中海诸岛之间建立一个海上贸易帝国也是另一个值得追求的目标。

      Going north into Naples is tempting, but war against the Byzantine Empire
      is a strategy that needs to be carefully considered before it is
      undertaken. If the Empire is busy with other wars, then it can be an easy
      way to expand quickly.

      向北进军那不勒斯是诱人的，但与拜占庭帝国开战的策略需要在采取之前谨慎考虑。如果帝国正忙于其他战争，那么这将是一个快速扩张的好机会。

      The problem with moving further up the Italian mainland is the Papacy. It
      bars the way north, and any attack on the Pope and his forces will result
      in excommunication, a serious problem unless the Papal lands can be
      quickly overrun.

      进一步向意大利大陆北部推进的问题在于教皇。这阻碍了向北的道路，任何对教皇及其势力的攻击都将导致逐出教会，除非能够迅速攻占教皇领地，这将是一个严重问题。

      A maritime strategy offers the chance of trade and the creation of an
      overseas empire on the mainland of Europe, or on the islands of the
      eastern Mediterranean. Pursuing both strategies is liable to be too
      expensive for the Sicilian treasury!

      海上战略提供了贸易的机会，并在欧洲大陆或东地中海的岛屿上创建海外帝国的可能性。然而，追求这两种策略可能对西西里财政而言过于昂贵！

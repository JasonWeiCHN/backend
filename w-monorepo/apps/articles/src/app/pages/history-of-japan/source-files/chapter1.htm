            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like many peoples, the Japanese have 
              a creation myth that makes them the children of the gods. The Japanese 
              home islands themselves came into being when the gods Izanagi and 
              Izanami stood on the bridge of heaven and stirred the waters of 
              the Earth with a spear. The drops of water that fell from the spear 
              tip gathered together to become the islands of Japan. The pair then 
              descended and raised the spear as the centre pole of their house. 
              Japan had been created. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Izanagi and Izanami had children. Their 
              first born was Amateratsu, the Sun Goddess, but like all families 
              there were problems: Izanagi slew his second child, the Fire God, 
              who had caused his mother, Izanami, enormous pain when he was born. 
              Izanami fled into the Underworld in grief at this killing. Susano-o, 
              their other son, was given to fits of temper. His violent behaviour 
              included throwing thunderbolts across the sky, and he even threw 
              a dead horse at Amateratsu, forcing her to hide in a cave. With 
              the Sun Goddess in hiding, the world was plunged into darkness. 
              Amateratsu was eventually tricked out of her hiding place by the 
              sight of her own beautiful reflection in a mirror and a necklace 
              of precious jewels…</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Susano-o did eventually make amends 
              by slaying a great serpent with eight heads and tails. The serpent 
              had a taste for young maidens and this, along with an equal appetite 
              for <i>sake</i>. Susano-o used both to lure the serpent into a trap, 
              then slew it once it was drunk! In hacking it to pieces, he discovered 
              a sword embedded in its tail which he then gave to Amateratsu. This 
              was the <i>Ame no murakomo no tsurugi </i>or &quot;Cloud Cluster 
              Sword.&quot;</font></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the first born child, Amateratsu inherited 
        the earth and in time sent her grandson, Ninigi, to rule Japan. She gave 
        him three gifts, the mirror, the jewels from the necklace and the &quot;Cloud 
        Cluster Sword&quot; to make his task easier. These gifts from heaven became 
        the Japanese Crown Jewels. Ninigi left heaven and ruled Japan, and the 
        throne eventually passed to his grandson, Jimmu, who was the first earthly 
        Emperor of Japan. He took the throne in 660BC on 11 February, a date which 
        is still a public holiday in Japan. The current Emperor is a lineal descendant 
        of this first Emperor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In around 200BC, Emperor Sujin and his son 
        Prince Yamato (later Emperor Keiko) are the agents of an important change 
        in Japanese history. The nation at this time was composed of many clans, 
        of which the strongest was the Imperial Yamato family. The Yamato (named 
        for their home province in central Honshu) were one clan amongst many 
        — but they claimed the right to rule because they were descended directly 
        from the Sun Goddess, Amateratsu. Sujin was the first Emperor to appoint 
        four generals to deal with rebels in his realm. Each general was given 
        the title of Shogun (which can be translated as &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; 
        at this point in history). Yamato Sujin is a figure partly of myth and 
        partly of history. He is the prototype of later samurai heroes: a skilled 
        and noble warrior, harried and hunted down by his many enemies who — although 
        he comes to a tragic end — eventually has a worthwhile death.</font></p>

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;In ancient times 
        skilful warriors first made themselves invincible, and then watched for 
        vulnerability in their opponents.&quot;</b></font></i></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size=2>- Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More realistically — but a lot less romantically 
        — archaeology has revealed that there have been humans in Japan for around 
        100,000 years. The original inhabitants of Japan were the Ainu, a people 
        unrelated to the Mongolian people who arrived and gradually drove them 
        out until the Ainu remained only on the island of Hokkaido. The incoming 
        people were split up along tribal and clan lines, but over the course 
        of time the Yamato clan came to dominate from its central position on 
        the Kanto plain. The Yamato chieftains also consolidated their power by 
        making an early form of Shinto the general religion of the country. After 
        all, rebellion against the descendant of a god is not as easy to contemplate 
        as fighting another warlord! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the early period of Yamato rule the 
        influence of the mainland began to be felt in Japanese culture. Both China 
        and Korea had already advanced to a comparatively high level of civilisation. 
        Thanks to the relative ease of travel and trade from the kingdom of Paekche 
        in southern Korea, iron, Chinese writing, literature and philosophy came 
        into the Yamato lands. The Yamato regime even adopted Chinese script for 
        its documents, and the first dependable records in Japanese history date 
        to around 430AD. The Yamato also imported a religion too: Buddhism appeared 
        in Japan about 100 years later. Japan’s position off the mainland gave 
        two benefits: culture, technology and ideas could be brought into the 
        country, but the voyage to Japan was just difficult enough to help keep 
        out unwanted ideas and influences. That said, the Yamato government was 
        strongly based on the Chinese system: there were eight carefully graded 
        ranks of court official and a great council, the <i>Dajokan</i>,<i> </i>ruled 
        through local governors. Everything was controlled from the capital — 
        Nara in Yamato province after 710AD — while Kyoto became the Imperial 
        home and remained so until 1868.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the Yamato came to rule all of Japan, 
        by the 9<sup>th</sup> century the Emperors were actually pulling back 
        from the day-to-day business of ruling a country. They were becoming <i>symbols 
        </i>of power rather than the <i>wielders </i>of power. As the Emperors 
        retired from government, control passed to the court officials, particularly 
        the Fujiwara family. The Emperors continued to reign, but they no longer 
        ruled the country. In 858AD, a Fujiwara prince, Yoshifusa, became the 
        regent for his one-year-old grandson (having made sure that his daughter 
        had married into the Imperial family). The Fujiwara also made sure that 
        family members filled all the important jobs at court and in the general 
        administration of the country. Eventually, Fujiwara Motosune was announced 
        as the <i>kampuku</i> — a &quot;civil dictator&quot; — in 884, and he 
        was followed a century later by the cleverest of the Fujiwara, Michinaga. 
        He made sure that five successive Emperors married one of his daughters, 
        thus making sure of the family position at Court! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fujiwara period was a time when Japanese 
        culture came into its own, leaving its Chinese-dominated roots behind. 
        Michinaga’s dictatorship is one of the classical ages of Japanese literature, 
        for example. At the same time, however, the Fujiwara were changing the 
        way that Japan was governed. The central government became corrupt and 
        weak. Land ownership started shifting to great estates. The nobles who 
        held government offices were given tax-free hereditary estates as payments. 
        Many peasants and lesser landholders were only too happy to hand over 
        their property to these estates to escape from the heavy taxes levied 
        on them! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At around the same time, the <i>samurai 
              </i>were coming to prominence as more than just another group of 
              fighting men. Like the medieval knights of Europe, the samurai were 
              the leaders of common foot soldiers. Like the knights it was possible 
              to win promotion to the ranks of the samurai. And like the knights, 
              to be samurai also implied a degree of service to a superior. In 
              the case of the samurai, this service was to the Emperor, a noble 
              or a warlord. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Imperial government found the samurai 
              incredibly useful in putting down rebellions, but with the shift 
              in power to mighty land-owners, the loyalties of the samurai also 
              shifted. The samurai came to serve and protect the great lords, 
              fighting against other great landlords, bandits and rebellious locals. 
              Although some of these samurai were from humble families, the clans 
              that prospered and attracted allies could trace their ancestors 
              back for centuries, often to some (minor) Imperial relative banished 
              from Court to seek his fortune elsewhere. Among these clans of aristocratic 
              samurai were the Minamoto in the east and the Taira in the south 
              west of Japan. </font></p>

      </table>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No longer content to merely serve, the samurai 
        began to interfere in government politics. It’s worth considering all 
        the political and military action that happened over the next decades, 
        because it set the pattern for later Japanese history: a pattern of ruthless 
        power politics with the winner taking all and losers, well, losing their 
        heads!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1155 there was a crisis in the Imperial 
        succession. There were two ex-Emperors at the Imperial Court and Emperor 
        Konoe was a sickly child. When Konoe was poisoned the Fujiwara clan backed 
        Ex-Emperor Sotoku. His father, however, the ex-Emperor Toba insisted that 
        another of his sons should be the new Emperor, and Go-Shirakawa duly ascended 
        the throne. Toba, however, died in 1156 and both the Emperors summoned 
        their supporters to the capital. The Taira and Minamoto clans divided 
        by personal loyalties, but the important point was that it was the samurai 
        that were to decide the course of Imperial politics, not the Fujiwara 
        court officials. </font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Way of the 
        warrior is death. This means choosing death whenever there is a choice 
        between life and death. It means nothing more than this. It means to see 
        things through, being resolved.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Yamamoto Tsunenori, Ha 
        Gakure (Hidden Leaves)</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the Battle of Hogen, Sotuku’s samurai 
        were defeated. Emperor Go-Shirakawa had an expectation that the defeated 
        samurai would pay the price for their defiance. The only important Taira 
        samurai to support Sotuku was so unpopular among his kinsmen that his 
        execution was an easy one to order for the leader of the clan, Taira Kiyomori. 
        The Minamoto family had backed Sotuku in greater strength and their clan 
        leader, Minamoto Tameyoshi was put to death on the orders of his son, 
        Yoshitomo in an act of loyalty. Tameyoshi’s son (and Yoshitom’s brother), 
        Tametomo, was deliberately maimed and exiled, but became among the first 
        samurai to kill himself by cutting open his own stomach in an act of <i>hara-kiri</i>. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All these deaths helped the Taira clan rise 
        rapidly to power in the Imperial Court. Once he was secure, Emperor Go-Shirakawa 
        decided that he had had enough of ruling and abdicated in favour of his 
        son, Nijo. Taira Kiyomori took a leaf out of the Fujiwara book, had himself 
        declared Prime Minister and began a policy of making sure that Imperial 
        wives and concubines came from his clan. There were, however, still members 
        of the Minamoto clan at court, and some of the Fujiwara clan persuaded 
        them that revenge was a good idea. All in all, the Minamoto didn’t take 
        much persuading.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This time, in 1159-60, the civil war that 
        followed was a straightforward fight between the Taira and the Minamoto. 
        Although the war seemed to go well initially for the Minamoto, events 
        soon turned against them. The Taira attacked the Minamoto headquarters, 
        and then lured them into a counter-attack that failed when Minamoto Yorimasa 
        refused to join in because he could not violate his duty to the Emperor. 
        The surviving Minamoto were pursued and slaughtered without mercy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Minamoto Yoshitomo fled with three of his 
        sons one of whom, Tomonaga, was so badly wounded that he begged his father 
        to kill him so that the others could flee with more speed. Yoshimoto did 
        this, but to no avail. He was caught and murdered in his bath, taken when 
        he thought he had outrun his pursuers. Taira Kiyomori then beheaded the 
        Minamoto clan — literally. Even Tomonaga didn’t escape further punishment, 
        even though his father had already killed him. His body was dug up and 
        beheaded too!</font></p>

        this swift snake? It can. Even people who dislike one another will help

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Taira Kiyomori was seemingly unassailable. 
        He had beaten his samurai rivals and beaten the Fujiwara at their own 
        game. In 1180 his grandson (via his daughter), Emperor Antoku, took the 
        throne. Kiyomori, however, hadn’t quite killed all the Minamoto and in 
        20 years the survivors had become strong enough to challenge him once 
        again. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Gempei War would last for five years. 
        (The name comes from the Chinese pronunciation of the ideographs in the 
        Taira and Minamoto clan names). Once again, the Minamoto (and Fujiwara) 
        opposed the Taira, but this time they were supported by the <i>sohei</i>, 
        warrior monks from the temples of Nara and Kyoto. As an aside, these warrior 
        monks — who despite being monks were actually often fanatical fighters 
        — intervened at several critical points in Japanese history, this being 
        one. However, the Taira were initially successful again, defeating the 
        Minamoto army at the battles of Uji and Ishibashiyama. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1183 the course of the war began to turn 
        for the Minamoto clan. They won a series of brilliant victories, culminating 
        in 1185 with the Battle of Dano-Ura. Both the Taira and Minamoto clans 
        aboard fleets of warships and headed into the Straits of Shimonoseki. 
        In the middle of the Taira fleet was the Emperor Antoku. He was still 
        a child and the symbol of Taira and Imperial legitimacy, and thus an important 
        element of the Taira claim to rule Japan. What happened at the Battle 
        of Dano-Ura was virtually a land battle fought from ship to ship. The 
        sea is supposed to have run red with blood during the battle as the Minamoto 
        smashed the Taira army. The unfortunate Emperor Antoku was drowned, and 
        his deeply symbolic replica of the <i>Ame no murakomo no tsurugi, </i>the 
        &quot;Cloud Cluster Sword&quot; that the Sun Goddess had given the original 
        Emperor was lost overboard too. Fortunately, it was just a replica, but 
        the symbolic damage done was almost as bad as if the original had gone. 
        If this sounds odd, it’s worth remembering that the Emperors were, for 
        all the struggling clans seeking to control them, the direct descendants 
        of the Sun Goddess and as important for their symbolism as such as for 
        any real earthly power that came through controlling them.</font></p>

        to Kamakura on the Kanto plain (near modern Tokyo). The old Imperial Court 
        was ignored and became largely irrelevant to the running of the country.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eventually, however, the Hojo clan replaced 
        the Minamoto family. They did it through a clever series of murders and 
        conspiracies that killed every Minamoto heir and many of their supporters. 
        The new Hojo rulers, however, never bothered becoming shoguns. Instead, 
        they appointed a series of puppets to the role, including even young children! 
        The Hojo ruled as <i>shikken</i>, or regents, which meant that there was 
        a figurehead shogun nominally ruling for a distant, symbolic Emperor, 
        while a third person with actual power <i>really </i>ran the country…</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This apparently cumbersome arrangement worked 
        well enough for the Hojo to hold on to power until 1333. In 1274 and 1281, 
        the Hojo were able to organise Japanese resistance to two invasions by 
        Kublai Khan, the ruler of the Mongols. The 1281 expedition was finally 
        destroyed by the <i>kami-kaze</i>, the divine wind that saved Japan. Beating 
        the Mongols, however, had weakened Hojo resources and power slipped away 
        from the clan. They were unable to resist an Imperial Restoration to return 
        Emperor Go-Daigo to power and the shogunate capital of Kamakura (which 
        the Hojo had kept) fell in 1333. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Go-Daigo did actually try to restore the 
        Imperial administrative system and do away with the shogunate, but he 
        was frustrated in this when his vassals the Ashikaga rebelled. The Ashikaga 
        drove Emperor Go-Daigo from Kyoto and set up another Emperor under their 
        direct control. The &quot;Wars between the Courts&quot; dragged on for 
        56 years as Go-Daigo and his heirs fought against the Ashikaga shoguns 
        and their emperors. In 1392, however, an Ashikaga ambassador convinced 
        the enemy (and true) Emperor to abdicate and give up the Crown Jewels 
        and other Imperial regalia. With their puppets now seen as the rightful 
        Emperors, the Ashigaka shoguns came into their own, but their power was 
        to be relatively short-lived. The Ashikaga period was one of great refinement 
        of manners, of great art and literary works and, incidentally, marked 
        the rise of Buddhism as a political force. In 1441 the shogun Ashigaka 
        Yoshinori was assassinated and was followed by his eight-year-old son. 
        He too died, and was followed by his younger brother, Yoshimasa. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though he lasted for 30 years as shogun, 
        Yoshimasa couldn’t — or more correctly wouldn’t — halt the decline of 
        his family fortunes. Real power had passed from the shogun to the other 
        great samurai families who had become a class of hereditary feudal lords 
        called <i>daimyo</i>. The Ashikaga shoguns were never able to control 
        these daimyo, and this failure was to lead to a century of terrible violence.</font></p>

        This is the period of <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the Ashikaga shoguns became more interested 
        in the intricacies of the tea ceremony and poetry, other forces were on 
        the move. The word <i>daimyo </i>can be translated as &quot;one who aspires 
        to something better&quot; and aspirations to power were not noticeable 
        by their absence among the daimyo! All the daimyo were ambitious and the 
        greatest of them certainly nurtured dreams of replacing the Ashikaga Shogunate. 
        This is quite understandable, because the Ashikaga were no longer capable 
        of effective government. Ashikaga Yoshimasa, for example, tried to abdicate 
        as Shogun and even pawned his armour to pay for his aesthetic (and expensive) 
        pastimes, such as his flower-viewing parties! This is hardly what you 
        would expect of someone whose title means &quot;Barbarian-subduing Commander 
        in Chief&quot;, and it was not the sort of behaviour that was going to 
        keep control of increasingly belligerent daimyo, who had little reason 
        to respect the authority of the Shogunate. </font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">The Ikki and The Ashigaru</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;Using order to

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The daimyo weren’t alone in aspiring to something 
        better. And at this point it’s necessary to look back a couple of decades 
        to the early years of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. By this time, the traditional 
        docility of the peasantry had reached its end. By and large — and unlike 
        European peasants of the same era — Japanese peasants were usually safe 
        from the armies that tramped across their fields. Apart from having crops 
        damaged or stolen, they didn’t have to worry about war destroying their 
        lives. Japanese peasants were unlikely to be murdered, raped or pressed 
        into military service in one army or another. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead, they had another problem: the taxmen 
        of the Shogun. Expensive pastimes and refined tastes need money to pay 
        for them, and the Ashikaga’s tax collectors raised that money with consummate 
        efficiency. At times, they took up to seventy percent of the harvest as 
        tax. In return, the peasants got nothing, and it wasn’t just the peasants 
        at the bottom of the social ladder who were suffering. There had always 
        been the <i>ji-samurai</i>, a class of &quot;gentleman farmers&quot; in 
        between the samurai who did nothing but fight and the peasants who did 
        nothing but work the land. Like the lesser peasantry, they too were being 
        squeezed out of existence by taxes, or being driven to seek the protection 
        of the daimyo — in return for handing over all their lands to the daimyo’s 
        clan, of course.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, all this changed with the formation 
        of mutual defence leagues or <i>ikki </i>by the ji-samurai and the peasants. 
        They were a genuine expression of popular discontent and gave rise to 
        a series of peasants’ revolts: in 1428 a rising in Kyoto triggered revolts 
        throughout Japan. In 1441 the ikki returned to Kyoto again, driven there 
        by high taxes and endless debts, almost besieging the city in an outburst 
        of rioting and arson. After a week of violence, the Shogunate cancelled 
        the peasants’ debts to the moneylenders and pawnbrokers (which undoubtedly 
        did nothing for the Shogun’s standing with moneylenders and pawnbrokers!) 
        and set the pattern for future behaviour by the ikki. They came back to 
        Kyoto in 1447, 1451, 1457 and 1461. In 1457, for example the ikki managed 
        to defeat an army of 800 samurai who had been sent against them!</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Way means inducing 
        the people to have the same aim as the leadership, so that they will share 
        death and share life, without fear of danger.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other escape for a peasant from the oppressive 
        taxman was to run away and join one or other of the many clan armies under 
        the daimyo. All that he needed was armour and weaponry, and these were 
        easy to obtain — thanks to years of warfare Japan was a country awash 
        with weapons. The possibility of elevation from the ranks of peasantry 
        was slight but it was there and there was always booty to be taken. These 
        peasant soldiers, the <i>ashigaru</i> (or &quot;light feet&quot;, as the 
        word directly translates) were a useful asset to a good commander, even 
        if their discipline left a lot to be desired. From the start, the ashigaru 
        were notorious for looting, and their morale was not that of the true 
        samurai. But in the wars that followed every daimyo made extensive use 
        of ashigaru troops to support their samurai warriors — they became an 
        indispensable and relatively cheap source of military might.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s also worth noting that the ashigaru 
        and the ikki were a definite change in the social pattern of Japan, and 
        in the warfare of the time. They mark the start of a trend called <i>gekokujo</i>, 
        or &quot;the low oppress the high&quot; by Japanese historians. This trend 
        was to culminate during the Sengoku period with vassals overthrowing some 
        of the established warrior clans, liege-lords to whom they should have 
        been loyal to the point of death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But clearly, with all these troubles and 
        slow changes in the &quot;natural order&quot; of the Japanese hierarchy, 
        the Ashikaga Shogunate was in no position to dictate terms to the daimyo 
        when it had to give way to mere peasants. The situation was ripe for trouble, 
        and trouble wasn’t long in coming. </font></p>

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The start of the Onin War in 1467 marks the 
        true beginning of the Sengoku Period, although we have seen that the signs 
        of an end to the old order were visible long before this time. So called 
        because the fighting began in the first year of the period of Onin, the 
        war was unusual because nearly all the immediate fighting happened within 
        the city of Kyoto itself. Even after the Ikki-inspired rioting of the 
        previous decades, the capital was still the most magnificent city in Japan. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Onin War ostensibly began when the Shogun, 
        Yoshimasa — the same shogun who had tried to pawn his armour to pay for 
        his tea ceremonies —proclaimed his brother, Yoshimi, to be his heir as 
        shogun. He even dragged the surprised man from a monastery to do this. 
        A year later, he changed his mind when his first son, Yoshihisa, was born. 
        At the same time, the Yamana and Hosokawa clans had spent years as rivals, 
        interfering in the affairs of others with varying degrees of success. 
        With two potential candidates to be the next shogun, it was almost inevitable 
        that each family would choose to back a different side. Yamana Sozen, 
        called the &quot;Red Monk&quot; thanks to his terrible temper and membership 
        of the priesthood, decided to support the infant heir, Yoshihisa. Hosokawa 
        Katsumoto on the other hand, threw his clan behind Yoshimi, the current 
        shogun’s brother. Just to add fuel to the fire and make it more even more 
        bitter and personal, the two leaders were related, as Yamana Sozen was 
        the father-in-law of Hosokawa Katsumoto. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two sides gathered their armies in Kyoto. 
        The Yamana gathered 80,000 samurai and other soldiers, while the Hosokawa 
        forces numbered some 85,000 men. The numbers involved are interesting, 
        and show just how wealthy Japan was at this time. Compared to European 
        armies of the same time, these are enormous numbers, especially when it 
        is remembered that these are <i>clan </i>armies. For example, during the 
        Wars of the Roses in England — a civil war on the other side of the world 
        that was happening at this time — the armies raised rarely numbered more 
        than about 10-12,000 men on each side.</font></p>

        a short distance. Draw them in with the prospect of gain, take them by 
        confusion.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Neither side, however, could quite bring 
        itself to start trouble. The side that publicly struck first ran the risk 
        of being called rebels by the weak shogunate, and being branded a rebel 
        would lose support. Eventually, however, the tension grew too great. With 
        another 20,000 Yamana men marching on Kyoto, a Hosokawa mansion mysteriously 
        burnt to the ground. Then Hosokawa troops attacked a Yamana food supply 
        line. It didn’t take much longer for the serious fighting to begin and 
        by July 1467 — only two months after the battle in Kyoto had begun — the 
        northern parts of the city were in ruins. The two sides settled down behind 
        hasty barricades and began static warfare of raids and counter-raids. 
        Everyone who could fled from Kyoto and the armies took over. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The war went on and on, as neither side could 
        actually work out a way of stopping the fighting. Yamana Sozen and Hosokawa 
        Katsumoto both died in 1473, and the war dragged on. Eventually, however, 
        the Yamana lost heart as the label of &quot;rebel&quot; was at last having 
        some effect. Ouchi Masahiro, one of the Yamana generals, eventually burned 
        his section of Kyoto and left. It was 1477, some ten years after the fighting 
        had begun! Kyoto was now looted as the mobs moved in to take what was 
        left. Neither clan had achieved its aims, other than to kill some of the 
        other clan.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During all of this the shogun did nothing. 
        Ashikaga Yoshimasa can only be described as having a &quot;passing acquaintance&quot; 
        with reality. He certainly didn’t seem to care what was happening to Japan. 
        While Kyoto was wrecked, he spent his time on poetry readings and other 
        high cultural events and in planning the <i>Ginkaku-ji</i>, a Silver Pavilion 
        to rival the Golden Pavilion that his grandfather had built. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The fighting in Kyoto, however, had serious 
        consequences throughout Japan. The Onin War — and the shogun’s lack of 
        any response — &quot;sanctioned&quot; private wars between the daimyo, 
        which now spread until no part of the country was untouched by violence. 
        The daimyo could see that they were now free to settle any dispute at 
        the point of a sword. After all, who was going to stop them?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the battles in Kyoto had been abandoned, 
        the war had spilled over into the rest of Japan. In Yamashiro province, 
        the Hatakeyama clan had split into two parts that fought each other to 
        a standstill. This stalemate, however, was to have serious consequences. 
        In 1485, the peasantry and ji-samurai (lesser samurai) had had enough 
        and revolted. They set up their own army and forced the clan armies to 
        leave the province. The ikki were becoming a powerful force, not just 
        armed mobs. In 1486 they even set up a provisional government for Yamashiro 
        province.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Kaga province, things went even further. 
        Founded in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the Ikko were a sect of Amida 
        Buddhists who drew most of their support from the peasant classes. Unlike 
        other — rather aristocratic — Buddhist sects, the Ikko made every effort 
        to appeal to the common people, which gave them enormous practical power. 
        Perhaps foolishly, one of the prominent lords of Kaga province, Togashi 
        Maschika, enlisted their help in his part of the Onin War. Included in 
        his army, the Ikko began evolving into the <i>Ikko-ikki</i>, a force of 
        fanatical holy warriors. The Ikko-ikki were convinced by their leaders 
        that paradise was the reward for death in battle and, consequently, nothing 
        daunted them. The greater the odds against them, the more the Ikko-ikki 
        fought like fiends. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Togashi Maschika had made a rod for his own 
        back. In 1488 the Ikko-ikki revolted, expelled him from Kaga, and took 
        control of the province. In 1496, the Ikko-ikki began building a fortified 
        &quot;cathedral&quot; as a headquarters at the mouth of the Yodo River. 
        They chose the site for the <i>Ishiyama Hongan-ji </i>well, as Osaka Castle 
        — where the last battles of the Sengoku period would be fought a hundred 
        years later — was eventually built at the very same spot. As before (with 
        the ikki), the rise of the Ikko-ikki was part of the process of <i>gekokujo</i>: 
        &quot;the low oppress the high.&quot;</font></p>

              had to wait for 20 years until the ikki (of all people) gave the 
              Imperial family enough money to pay for the ceremony. Go-Nara lived 
              in a wooden hut, and was even reduced to selling his autograph;

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The central government had, for all intents 
        and purposes, vanished. The daimyo were free to wage as many wars as they 
        wanted or could afford. The lesser samurai families were quite free to 
        dream of greater power and steal land from each other as well. The story 
        of Ise Shinkuro is a good example. He was a fairly obscure samurai, until 
        he chose to get involved in the internal affairs of the Ashikaga. Ashikaga 
        Chacha had been ordered to join the priesthood, but he refused. Shinkuro 
        took it upon himself to besiege Chacha and then force him to commit suicide. 
        Shinkuro’s reward was the Mastery of Izu, and he lost no time in changing 
        his name to Hojo Soun (he had also decided to take a Buddhist name at 
        around the same time). The Hojo had, of course, been rulers of Japan hundreds 
        of years earlier, but Shinkuro — or Hojo Soun as he now was — had no connection 
        with the family at all until he married off a son to a distant descendent 
        of the original Hojo!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hojo Soun now decided to expand his lands. 
        A deer hunt gave him the opportunity to have a neighbouring lord assassinated, 
        and gave him control of Odowara. He then moved to secure the Sagami and 
        Musashi provinces, and then expanded on the Kanto plain. He waited until 
        the Uesugi family were occupied with their own problems, then managed 
        to seize their castle at Edo, the old Imperial capital (and now the site 
        of Tokyo). Soun’s son, Ujitsuna and grandson, Ujiyasu, continued his struggles 
        against the Uesugi and defeated them in 1542 at Kawagoe Castle. The point 
        of this account is that Hojo Soun (or Ise Shinkuro) had come from nowhere 
        and, within the space of three generations he and his family had carved 
        themselves out a significant domain. They did it through treachery and 
        violence against their &quot;betters&quot;, something that could never 
        have happened if the Ashikaga shogunate had been doing its job.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Uesugi clan was also busy with its other 
        struggles. Their most famous general, Uesugi Kenshin, was actually adopted 
        into the clan at the time it had reached its lowest point in around 1552. 
        He managed to mount some raids against the (new) Hojo clan, but he spent 
        most of his time fighting against the Takeda clan and, in particular, 
        Takeda Shingen. The two sides were well matched, but their battles were 
        a little strange. Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen fought a series of 
        battles on the Kawanakajima plain in Shinano province in 1553. They returned 
        to the same place and fought all over again in 1554, 1555, 1556, 1557 
        and 1563, treating the battles almost as rituals. At much the same time, 
        Takeda Shingen was in the process of absorbing Shinano, the lands of the 
        Murakami Yoshikiyo — it was the Murakami clan that asked Uesugi Kenshin 
        for help and started his long rivalry with Shingen. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ouchi Masahiro had managed to outlive his 
        Yamana sponsors and gain his clan substantial power, and his son Yoshioki 
        was equally warlike. The family prospered until Masahiro’s grandson, Ouchi 
        Yoshitaki took over. With Yamaguchi as a secure and rich home territory, 
        after 1543 Yoshitaki worked out that warfare was a little too dangerous, 
        and took to a life of culture, aided by exiled courtiers from Kyoto. Unfortunately 
        for him, his two chief retainers Mori Motonari and Sue Harukata warned 
        him that he was risking everything by this attitude and that his domain 
        was ripe for a coup under the command of some ambitious samurai. Just 
        to make sure that his warning was right, Sue Harukata rebelled. Trapped 
        and apparently friendless, Ouchi Yoshitaki killed himself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This wasn’t the end of the matter, though. 
        Mori Motonari felt it was his duty to avenge his former master, but he 
        took his time. In 1555 he managed to lure Sue Harukata, who had more troops, 
        into capturing a castle on the island of Miyajima. However, once there, 
        his numbers were less important because he was trapped on the island. 
        The battle that followed ended with the defeated and demoralised Sue forces 
        killing themselves <i>en masse</i>. As a result, the Mori clan rose to 
        become the mightiest clan in Western Japan. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This shifting pattern of rivalries and alliances 
        was typical of the times. One clan would ally with another against the 
        threat from a third, only to find that their allies had become just as

        than any external threat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai warfare had always used dirty tricks, 
        assassination and outright treachery but during earlier conflicts, such 
        as the Gempei War, the clans who had behaved in this fashion were widely 
        regarded as villains. In the Sengoku period, however, all was fair in 
        love and war. A quick murder was as acceptable as winning a battle. The 
        new daimyo had read Sun Tzu and taken his work seriously, especially the 
        sections that dealt with the use of spies and assassins. The daimyo, of 
        course, had access to some of the best spies and assassins from any period 
        of history anywhere in the world — the <i>ninja</i>. It was a wise man 
        who took precautions against assassination, even if he didn’t plot the 
        deaths of his rivals and superiors. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the middle of all this strife, the first 
        Europeans arrived in Japan, when a group of Portuguese traders landed 
        near Kyushu in around 1543. The Europeans brought two major cultural items 
        with them: effective gunpowder weapons, and Christianity. We’ll return 
        to the influence of Christianity slightly later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gunpowder weapons weren’t a complete mystery 
        to the samurai. They almost certainly knew about Chinese handguns, and 
        the Mongols had used primitive hand grenades against the samurai in 1274. 
        But gunpowder hadn’t really &quot;arrived&quot; in Japanese warfare, until 
        now. The guns that the Portuguese brought to Japan were arquebuses or 
        matchlocks. They were light enough to be used by one man and relatively 
        safe, at least when compared to earlier types of firearms. The arquebus 
        had a slow rate of fire on the battlefield, but it did have one massive 
        advantage that was recognised in Japan as quickly as it had been spotted 
        in Europe. Training as an archer takes years of dedicated work. Learning 
        to use an arquebus takes days, at most. The ashigaru were a pool of soldiers 
        in every army ready and waiting for an easy-to-use missile weapon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the level of skill that Japanese swordsmiths 
        and armourers exhibited at this time, it’s hardly surprising that it took 
        remarkably little time before the arquebus was being produced in Japan, 
        and that it was adopted enthusiastically by the daimyo for their armies. 
        However, although everyone could see that the arquebus was a useful addition 
        to the armoury, it would take time before someone would integrate a substantial 
        force of arquebusiers into his army in a tactically effective manner.</font></p>

              and becoming a family of new shoguns was undoubtedly tempting for 
              the Hojo, Takeda and Uesugi clans, any attempt to do so would invite 
              trouble. The first daimyo to leave his home domain would, in effect, 
              invite his rivals to invade.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s now time to consider the Oda clan, 
              another one of those small samurai families who had managed to gain 
              control of a province (Owari, in their case) during the Sengoku 
              period. In 1551, the ruthless Oda Nobunaga became head of the clan. 
              In 1558, he gained the services of an ashigaru called Toyotomi Hideyoshi, 
              who was to prove a superb follower. At the same time, another young 
              samurai, Tokugawa Ieyasu, was in the service of Imagawa clan — although, 
              technically, he was a hostage against his family’s good behaviour. 
              These three men were eventually to decide the fate of Japan. For 
              the moment, though, there were others who had designs on Kyoto.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Imagawa Yoshimoto, the leader of the Imagawa, 
        was one daimyo with an ambition to be Shogun, and in 1560 he marched towards 
        Kyoto, taking advantage of the fact that the Hojo and Uesugi were busy 
        fighting each other. Between him and his target lay three provinces, one 
        of which just happened to be Oda Nobunaga’s home, Owari. Initially, the 
        campaign went well for the Imagawa. Tokugawa Ieyasu took the frontier 
        fort at Marune and all that stood between the Imagawa’s 25,000 men and 
        victory was Nobunaga and his small army of 2000 soldiers. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nobunaga decided to attack. After a brilliant 
        bit of trickery, he managed to convince Yoshimoto that his army was camped 
        in one place, then ambushed the main Imagawa force in a gorge. The Battle 
        of Okehazama lasted minutes rather than hours. Yoshimoto was killed, and 
        only realised at the last minute that the samurai who were attacking weren’t 
        part of his own force who were the worse for drink. Oda Nobunaga was now 
        a real power in the land and now the new liege of Tokugawa Ieyasu. He 
        had been freed from his obligation to the Imagawa clan by Yoshimoto’s 
        death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The temptation to march on Kyoto must have 
        been there for Nobunaga as well, but he bided his time and secured alliances 
        with his neighbours by marrying off his daughter and younger sister. He 
        had also married the daughter of another neighbour, Saito Toshimasa, a 
        one-time oil merchant turned daimyo in Mino province, who was widely regarded 
        as a completely bad lot. Toshimasa was rather fond of torturing people 
        in general and boiling people in particular! However, he came to a suitably 
        bad end when his own son, Yoshitatsu, killed him and took control. He, 
        in turn, died of leprosy, but not before Nobunaga had declared war to 
        avenge the rather nasty Toshimasa who was, after all, his father-in-law. 
        This excuse was all he needed to brush the Saito clan aside so that his 
        route to Kyoto and the shogunate was open. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was given 
        the job of destroying the last of the Saito clan, which he carried out 
        in 1564. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All Nobunaga needed was a good excuse to 
        march on the capital, and in 1567, he got one. Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 
        heir to the shogunate, and a valuable symbol for that very reason. His 
        brother, Yoshiteru, had been previous shogun, and completely under the 
        control of a couple of malicious (and incidentally Christian) courtiers 
        Miyoshi Chokei and Matsunaga Hisahide, who eventually killed him so that 
        they could install his much younger cousin as an even more controllable 
        puppet. Yoshiaki was in danger from the pair, but managed to escape and 
        take refuge with Nobunaga. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in November 1568 
        with Yoshiaki as his own puppet Ashikaga shogun. Nobunaga ruled as the 
        real power behind the throne of a ceremonial commander-in-chief of a ceremonial 
        Emperor. There were dynastic reasons why the Oda family would have been 
        unacceptable as shoguns in their own right, but the new arrangement gave 
        Nobunaga the power anyway.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the rest of his life, he would devote 
        his energies to crushing his remaining rivals. In this, he had two fine 
        lieutenants in Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nobunaga was quite 
        powerful enough to give them all the authority they needed. This is a 
        sign that samurai politics had moved on a little from the dog-eat-dog 
        days. At one point, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu would have been busily plotting 
        against Nobunaga and each other… Now, however, Ieyasu was despatched to 
        crush the Ikko-ikki (in 1563) and had a narrow escape in doing so when 
        two bullets penetrated his armour but didn’t go on to wound him! Nobunaga’s 
        next — successful — proxy campaign was against Miyoshi Chokei and Matsunaga 
        Hisahide who were defeated at the Battle of Sakai in 1567. This battle 
        is noteworthy because of the large numbers of Christian samurai on both 
        sides, who took Mass together before the fighting. Christianity — or perhaps 
        the dedicated Jesuit missionaries who were preaching Christianity — appealed 
        to the samurai and from this point Christian samurai were not unusual. 
        Although Oda Nobunaga never became a Christian, he did support Jesuit 
        missionaries in Japan, undoubtedly because of their political usefulness 
        against troublesome Buddhist sects. Wholesale persecution of Christians 
        still lay in the future.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The remainder of Nobunaga’s life was a succession 
        of campaigns to secure his control of the country. In 1570, he fell upon 
        the Asakura in Echizen province, but was forced to retreat when his own 
        brother-in-law, Asai Nagamasa, declared for the Asakura clan. Nobunaga 
        returned later in 1570 and fought the indecisive, but victorious Battle 
        of Anegawa. While his forces won the day, they didn’t crush the Asakura 
        and Asai. Troubles now multiplied for Nobunaga and he rapidly found he 
        was facing not only the Asakura and Asai army, but Ikko from Ishiyama 
        Hongan-ji and <i>sohei </i>(warrior monks) from Enryaku-ji near the capital. 
        In addition, Tokugawa Ieyasu was now facing both the Hojo army and Takeda 
        Shingen. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nobunaga appeared to be encircled, so he 
        decided to attack. His men surrounded Enryaku-ji and killed everyone — 
        man, woman or child — they found in or near the monastery. Nobunaga was 
        now free to turn against his other enemies, but Takeda Shingen moved against 
        him in 1572, almost trapping Tokugawa Ieyasu in Hamamatsu Castle. Ieyasu 
        was faced with a simple choice: stay where he was and fail in his duty 
        to prevent Shingen reaching Kyoto, or fight. He chose to leave the castle 
        and met the Takeda army in the snow at Mikata-ga-hara, a stretch of open 
        moors near the Magome River. The battle was indecisive, and both sides 
        eventually withdrew. Ieyasu returned to Hamamatsu Castle (his job of delaying 
        Shingen had been achieved); Shingen went home. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shingen came on again in spring 1573, this 
        time into Mikawa province, intent on taking Kyoto for himself. It was 
        not to be. In the fighting that followed, he was wounded by a bullet and 
        died some time later. This loss was a disaster for the Takeda clan as 
        Shingen’s son, Katsuyori, was not the man his father had been. Uesugi 
        Kenshin is said to have wept over the loss of so noble an enemy. Kenshin 
        himself was to die under somewhat mysterious circumstances in 1582. Although 
        nothing has ever been proved, Nobunaga was suspected of having used ninja 
        to remove another rival. One (probably untrue) version of the events around 
        Kenshin’s death is recounted in the section about ninja later in this 
        manual.</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A true samurai

        Takeda retainer</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It took two more years before the defeat 
        of the Takeda clan was secured. In 1575 Takeda Katsuyori surrounded Nagashino 
        Castle with his army, but the Oda defenders put up a gallant resistance. 
        Nobunaga saw that the relief expedition would be a chance to crush the 
        Takeda clan, and he was right. The Battle of Nagashino that followed was 
        a triumph for Oda Nobunaga and for the arquebus. Nobunaga organised his 
        3000 best shots into a single unit and placed them in three lines behind 
        a palisade of stakes. When the Takeda clan charged across a very waterlogged 
        battlefield a blast of gunfire every 20 seconds or so tore them to pieces. 
        Those that survived the gunfire were cut down by Nobunaga’s other soldiers. 
        Even the castle’s defenders left their walls and fell on the rear of the 
        Takeda army. The victory was complete. Katsuyori Takeda managed to escape 
        the carnage, but he was unable to threaten Nobunaga seriously again and 
        was killed in 1582. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nobunaga now turned eastwards towards the 
        Mori clan. Mori Motonari was dead, but his grandson, Mori Terumoto, ruled 
        a rich domain of ten provinces. Terumoto had been asking for trouble, 
        as he had run through Nobunaga’s naval blockade of the Ikko-ikki at Ishiyama 
        Hongan-ji. Nobunaga responded by sending an army with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, 
        his ashigaru general, and Akechi Mitsuhide (another of his samurai generals) 
        at its head. He continued his campaign against the Ikko-ikki, even building 
        warships with <i>iron plate </i>armour for use against them at one point! 
        It would be another 300 years before armour plate was used in the West. 
        The Ikko were eventually surrounded and in 1580 were forced to give in. 
        The warrior fanatics had at last been broken as a power. While all this 
        was happening, Nobunaga also started to build a castle at Azuchi on Lake 
        Biwa near Kyoto. It was colossal, and a sign of where the true power in 
        Japan now lay. It was also revolutionary for the way it took firearms 
        into account, with stout stone defences and loopholes for gunners. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nobunaga’s army now turned its full power 
        towards the Mori. Toyotomi Hideyoshi had been making steady progress, 
        and had besieged their castle at Takamtsu — even the course of the nearby 
        river was altered so that the place would flood! The entire Mori clan 
        gathered to try and lift the siege, and Hideyoshi summoned reinfocements 
        when he realised exactly what he was facing. Ieyasu and, as it turned 
        out, too many Oda warriors were sent out to beef up his army. Nobunaga 
        was left in Kyoto with only 100 men to guard him, instead of the 2000 
        who normally formed his bodyguard.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Akechi Mitsuhide, on the other hand, had 
        failed in his campaign against the Mori, and had suffered Nobunaga’s scorn 
        because of this and much else. He was moving near Kyoto at the time that 
        Nobunaga was almost unguarded. Quite why he turned his troops around and 
        attacked Nobunaga’s mansion in Kyoto has never been explained, but on 
        21 June 1582, Nobunaga was shot down on the orders of his own general. 
        He died thanks to the weapon with which he had transformed the battlefield: 
        the arquebus.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even by the standards of his age, Nobunaga 
        was a ruthless man — his sole idea of a clear victory was the extermination 
        of the enemy. But he did change Japan. His military improvements altered 
        the way wars were fought. At one time, peasants and ji-samurai would leave 
        the fields to fight. Under Nobunaga, men fought or they farmed. The samurai 
        and the ashigaru became warrior classes who didn’t have to return to the 
        land when it was time to gather the harvest. All they had to do was fight 
        for their overlord.</font></p>

        following the time-honoured precedent of slaughtering every one of Nobunaga’s 
        relatives that he could reach. Tokugawa Ieyasu had vanished into hiding. 
        Although it probably wasn’t Mitsuhide’s doing, the magnificent Azuchi 
        Castle was burned down. Days later, the Akechi shogunate was over. Hideyoshi 
        attacked and Mitsuhide fled. He was captured by plunder-seeking peasants 
        and beaten to death. He had been the &quot;Thirteen Day Shogun.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Toyotomi Hideyohsi was now the &quot;official&quot; 
        avenger of Nobunaga and in a very strong position. His humble ashigaru 
        beginnings made him popular among his own ashigaru soldiers and he was 
        a singularly able commander. Naturally, the surviving relatives of Oda 
        Nobunaga — in particular his third son, Nobutaka — were not too keen on 
        seeing Hideyoshi in control. There were also Nobunaga’s other generals 
        to consider as well. Apart from Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shibata Katsuie, Niwa 
        Nagahide, Takigawa Kazumasu and Ikeda Nobuteru had equally good claims 
        to take over from Nobunaga! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Warfare was the only likely result of all 
        this, despite — or perhaps because of — Hideyoshi’s suggestion that Nobunaga’s 
        one year old grandson should be the new clan leader. A puppet with a powerful 
        man behind him was a very traditional way of taking power. The next months 
        presented Hideyoshi with a difficult series of campaigns. By far the most 
        dangerous threat came from Shibata Katsuie. Katsuie had actually tried 
        to attack Akechi Mitsuhide, but had arrived too late to share in the credit 
        of killing him. Had Katsuie managed to co-ordinate his actions with those 
        of his allies, Oda Nobutaka and Takigawa Kazumasu, the three might well 
        have won. Ieyasu and the others were waiting too, either for a chance 
        to take the prize, or to make sure that they backed the winning side! 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Katsuie, however, was not blessed with wise 
        allies. While the Shibata lands were still snowed under, Nobutaka decided 
        to attack. This gave Hideyoshi the chance to divide and conquer his opponents. 
        Nobutaka was surrounded in the Oda clan’s Gifu Castle and begged for mercy. 
        At this point, Hideyoshi did something entirely remarkable: he spared 
        Nobutaka’s life and took hostages to ensure his future good behaviour. 
        In the just-passed old days, Nobutaka’s father, Nobunaga, would have killed 
        every enemy within reach! Hideyoshi then split Takigawa Kazumasu’s forces 
        by bribing a key garrison and even captured Kazumasu himself. </font></p>

        seeking peace without a treaty are plotting.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By this point, Shibata Katsuie was only just 
        able to send out troops thanks to the thawing snow, and Oda Nobutaka now 
        repaid mercy with rebellion. The Shibata general, Sakuma Morimasa, however, 
        made a serious error of judgement when — having failed to learn the lessons 
        of the Battle of Nagashino — he attacked arquebus-armed troops in a strong 
        position. The resulting Battle of Shizugatake in 1583 was a disaster for 
        the Shibata forces, and they were pursued back to the gates of Katsuie’s 
        castle. Recognising that his war against Hideyoshi was lost, Katusuie 
        took his own life and burned his fortress. When he heard the news, Oda 
        Nobutaka saw the writing on the wall for his own chances of success and 
        took his own life as well. </font></p>

            greatest generals. Both sides looked for allies, and the important 
            clans in Nobunaga’s old holdings divided between them. With two such 
            able commanders, stalemate was the inevitable result, although there 
            was much fighting, such as at the bloody Battle of Nagakute in 1584. 
            When the battle was over, Ieyasu sat down to count almost 2500 heads 
            taken from an enemy army of around 9000 soldiers. His army’s losses 
            were around 600 men, but the battle decided nothing.</font></td>

      </table>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the end, Ieyasu submitted to the authority 
        of Hideyoshi. His decision was supremely practical. Together, the two 
        men were unbeatable, and Hideyoshi, the older man, could not last forever… 
        With Ieyasu now an ally, Hideyoshi was in a position to conquer the rest 
        of Japan. That he managed this as quickly as he did is a tribute not only 
        to his military skills, but also to his political skills. When facing 
        Nobunaga, for example, there was little point in not fighting to the bitter 
        end — after all, he was likely to kill everyone whether they resisted 
        fiercely or not. Hideyoshi, however, was more political (or cunning). 
        He was generous towards his enemies, letting them keep some of their holdings 
        (but he did need conquered lands to use as rewards for his own loyal followers). 
        He also took hostages, but he didn’t kill off entire clans. He left them 
        in charge as they had been, having first secured their loyalty. As a result, 
        he managed to add the armies of his enemies to his own forces and grow 
        stronger over time. Hideyoshi, however, didn’t need to take all of a clan’s 
        landholdings, because he had also changed the way that samurai were rewarded 
        for their actions in battle. Rather than handing out land, he paid them 
        in gold! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hideyoshi was now master of Japan and now 
        free to pursue other aims. He built Osaka Castle on the site of the old 
        Ikko fortress of Ishiyama Hongan-ji. He also organised the most important 
        social change to take place in Japan: &quot;The Great Sword Hunt&quot;, 
        which started in 1588. Simply, all weapons in the hands of the peasantry 
        were taken away and melted down for use in the construction of Hideyoshi’s 
        Great Buddha. The only people who would be allowed to carry weapons from 
        now on would be warriors, and the social distinctions between unarmed 
        peasants, ashigaru soldiers and samurai — who could carry two swords –- 
        now became a fixed feature of the social landscape. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He also had plans for the conquest of China. 
        The story of this expedition is outside the scope of both this manual 
        and <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>, but the Korean War ended in strategic 
        failure for the Japanese. They failed to carve out a mainland empire, 
        but they did have the satisfaction of bringing back considerable loot. 
        Oddly, Tokugawa troops had taken no part in the fighting on the mainland.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1598, Hideyoshi was dying, but he had 
        enough of his old political skill left to appoint five regents to rule 
        in his infant son’s name. Toyotomu Hideyori was only five years old when 
        his father’s appointees took over. Of these, the most important was Tokugawa 
        Ieyasu, now staggeringly rich by any standards: his revenue from his lands 
        was 2,557,000 <i>koku </i>— a koku being the quantity of rice needed to 
        feed one man for one year. And this, remember, was his <i>revenue</i>, 
        not the value of his domains. The others were Ukita Hideie, Maeda Toshiie, 
        Mori Terumoto and Uesugi Kagaktasu. These were the most important daimyo 
        in Japan, and Hideyoshi obviously wanted them united behind his clan.

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ieyasu had other plans, but the opposition 
        to him came from a courtier outside the regency, a civil servant called 
        Ishida Mitsunari. On the other hand, Ieyasu had no desire to be seen as 
        the one starting any war, so he did little other than wait for Ishida 
        Mitsunari to make the first move. In the meantime, the &quot;significant 
        players&quot; declared for one side or another. Fortunately for Ieyasu, 
        most of Hideyohsi’s old supporters chose him as the natural military successor. 
        He also had one other piece of luck. In 1600, he met the first Englishman 
        to arrive in Japan, Will Adams. While Mr Adams was interesting enough, 
        his cargo of guns, ammunition and good quality European powder was far 
        more useful. Ieyasu made sure the whole lot found its way into his armoury.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ishida’s followers — usually referred to 
        as the Western Army — eventually made their move. Unfortunately for them, 
        the Tokugawa — Eastern — garrison of Fushimi Castle proved to be incredibly 
        stubborn and tied them down for too long. When the defenders were down 
        to their last two hundred men, they opened the gates and <i>repeatedly 
        </i>charged the Western Army! Although killed to the last man, they bought 
        enough time for Ieyasu to move against Ishida’s army. The two sides met, 
        or almost blundered into each other in the fog, at a narrow pass at Sekigahara 
        on 21 October 1600, in damp and miserable conditions. Both armies were 
        soaked through and neither side could see the other because of dense fog. 
        In the early part of the day, however, the fog lift and the battle commenced 
        as one huge, mud-soaked brawl. The Western Army, however, had never been 
        a united force, and once battle was joined, Kobayakawa Hideaki made no 
        effort to move against the Eastern army. When he did move, it was against 
        his own side.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By mid-afternoon, Ieyasu was again counting 
        the heads of his defeated enemies. Although he hadn’t secured a total 
        victory over every opponent, he must have been rather pleased with the 
        haul. Ishida’s challenge was over. The daimyo that survived — and had 
        sense enough to submit — prospered or suffered in direct relationship 
        to their allegiances at the battle. From this day on, Tokugawa Ieyasu 
        must have known that he would be the undisputed ruler of Japan. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1603, he was declared Shogun, the title 
        having been unused for nearly 30 years after the removal of Yoshiaki, 
        the last of the Ashikaga clan. There was still one opponent to deal with. 
        Toyotomi Hideyori was still alive and scheming. Ieyasu chose to wait and 
        had the sense to concentrate on good government over the next 14 years, 
        until the chance came to deal with this last enemy. When the excuse came 
        — an implied insult — it was a little feeble, but good enough. After a 
        long and inconclusive siege at Osaka Castle, Hideyori’s troops marched 
        out to meet the Tokugawa army. Hideyori’s troops fought with brave desperation, 
        while the Tokugawa army showed that it had become &quot;stale&quot; over 
        the years. It won, but without any real <i>elan</i>. The wars for control 
        of Japan were, however, finally at an end. No future rebellion would be 
        tolerated and the last of the Toyotomi, Hideyori’s eight-year-old son, 
        was put to the sword. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ieyasu had his final victory in 1615, but 
        he didn’t have much time to savour it. Within a year he was dead, his 
        remarkable constitution having failed to fight off stomach cancer (as 
        far as modern diagnosis can tell from this distance in time). But his 
        passing was not marked by war, assassination and fevered plotting among 
        his retainers. His son, Hidetada, quietly took control of the government 
        and became the second Tokugawa shogun. Ieyasu achieved a kind of immortality, 
        because he was deified as <i>To-sho-gu</i>, the Sun God of the East. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Tokugawa shoguns remained the undisputed 
        masters of Japan for the next 250 years. The Emperors remained shadowy 
        god-like figures insulated from real power. Meanwhile, the Tokugawas made 
        sure that Japan remained equally insulated from the world outside. Even 
        before the final victory at Osaka, the Tokugawa had turned against foreigners. 
        Christians were officially persecuted from 1612 onwards, the Spanish were 
        refused permission to land in Japan after 1624, and in the next ten years 
        the Japanese themselves were increasingly forbidden to travel. Japan was 
        to be sealed off, other than for limited contacts with small Dutch trading 
        missions. The shoguns were largely successful in their isolationism until 
        1853, when the arrival of a US Navy detachment under Commodore Perry — 
        and the threat of being incorporated into one of the expanding European 
        empires — forced home the idea that isolation as the only policy was no 
        longer workable. Japan had been left behind, a feudal backwater in the 
        newly modern, industrial, Victorian world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the face of these unwelcome facts, the 
        clans remained fiercely xenophobic and organised attacks on foreigners 
        in Japan, which in turn weakened the position of the Tokugawa shogun, 
        who could no longer control them. The Meiji Restoration that came in 1867 
        didn’t bring back the Emperors (naturally, they had never disappeared), 
        but it did restore power to the Imperial family and lead to the end of 
        the shogunate. The clans were disarmed and their fiefdoms were taken away 
        over the next decade. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new Imperial government set out to make 
        Japan a modern nation. In this, they were partly driven by the quite legitimate 
        fear of ending up as just another European colony in the Far East. In 
        the space of 50 years, Japan changed from a medieval society to a modern 
        industrial nation: no other country has ever changed so dramatically in 
        such a short space of time. With the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, the 
        Japanese proved that their transformation was complete when they defeated 
        the Russian Empire on both land and sea. Both the Imperial Army and Navy 
        proved that they were modern, forward-looking and equal to anything from 
        Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It hadn’t been an easy transition, though. 
        The &quot;last hurrah&quot; of the old samurai order came with the Satsuma 
        Rebellion in 1877 led by Saigo Takamori. A medieval samurai army fought 
        against a modern conscript army and was convincingly beaten. At the last, 
        samurai bravery alone hadn’t been enough to halt the future and Takamori 
        took his own life in the traditional fashion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ironically, it was in the Imperial Japanese 
        Army that broke the samurai rebels where the spirit of the samurai was 
        to live on…</font></p>

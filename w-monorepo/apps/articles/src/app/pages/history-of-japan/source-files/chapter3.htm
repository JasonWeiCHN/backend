              at a premium in Japan. The basis for nearly all wealth and prestige 
              in feudal Japan was land and the rice that the peasantry grew. It’s 
              worth remembering that the population of Japan was greater than 
              that of the whole of Medieval Western Europe — Japan has always 
              been a relatively crowded nation, and this has given extra impetus 
              to the demand for land.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The country itself is made up of four 
              main islands: northern Hokkaido, the main island Honshu, and the 
              smaller islands of Shikoku and Kyushu. <b><i>Shogun Total War </i></b>doesn’t 
              include Hokkaido for the simple reason that control of this island 
              wasn’t strategically or tactically important during the Sengoku 
              period. It was still largely a cold, under-developed &quot;backwater&quot;, 
              inhabited by the Ainu, the original inhabitants of Japan. Honshu 
              was the most important of the islands and remains so to this day; 
              it was control of the provinces of Honshu that brought victory to 
              the Tokugawa clan. It would, however, be a mistake to dismiss Shikoku 
              and Kyushu as irrelevant, as powerful daimyo arose on both islands. 
              The straits around those islands make superb protective moats behind 
              which quite a powerful army can be trained!</font></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The Asian mainland is just far 
      enough away to the west to be &quot;inconvenient&quot; for invading armies, 
      as the Mongols found out to their cost. This allowed the daimyo to fight 
      each other without really having to worry about the arrival of a Chinese 
      or Mongol army in their midst, eager to take advantage of a Japanese civil 
      war. Perhaps the Sengoku period would never have happened if the daimyo 
      had been forced to consider external threats. Then again, the Ancient Greek 
      cities squabbled continuously even though the Persian Empire regularly tried 
      to invade.</font> 
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="5"><b><a name="provinces" class="header">Provinces 
        </a><a href="#top"><img src="art/up.gif" width="30" height="14" border="0"></a></b></font></p>
      <p class="desthdr"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Even given 
        the scale of the strategic game in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>, the 
        provinces are functionally different. Each province in the game is valuable 
        in itself because of the money (measured in rice <i>koku</i>) that it 
        produces, because of its strategic position and because of the prestige 
        that ownership gives the controlling daimyo. This is true no matter where 
        the province happens to lie. The daimyo sets the tax rate across his whole 
        realm, but rich and properly developed provinces obviously give the maximum 
        tax income. At the same time, a daimyo has to be careful in balancing 
        his obvious need for money to pay for his armies, fortifications, spies, 
        and all the rest against the risk of starting a peasant rebellion. The 
        ikki defence leagues of peasants and ji-samurai are not going to remain 
        loyal forever if their overlords do nothing but squeeze them for taxes!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A province like Yamato or 
        Hida on the main island of Honshu is useful strategically because it allows 
        its owners to attack in many directions; this same strategic usefulness 
        can also be a liability to a weak overlord because the same province can 
        be overrun from all sides. Conversely, one of the provinces on Kyushu 
        is excellent defensively, but isolated from the centre of Japan with many 
        (often heavily) defended provinces between it and the centre of power 
        in Kyoto. Both kinds of province have their uses to skilled daimyo that 
        think in larger terms than just winning the next battle.</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;A 
        wise general strives to feed off the enemy’s land. Each bushel of food 
        taken from the enemy is equivalent to twenty carried from home.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><i>— Sun Tzu, 
        The Art of War</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Provinces also differ from 
        one another in one other important respect. In <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b> 
        many provinces have what can be termed a &quot;special ability&quot;. 
        Some provinces contain gold or other valuable mineral wealth that can 
        be mined, for example. Others are home to natural horsemen (and so cavalry 
        units are easy to produce there) or have a tradition of producing ninja 
        assassins. It’s a good idea to decide if the special conditions in a province 
        make it worth capturing, either because it will further your own plans 
        or deprive an enemy of a valuable resource.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">You can use a shinobi to 
        discover the details of a province before you attack it. Both the strategic 
        position of a province and its revenue need to be considered before it 
        is added to your holdings! There is, of course, a double benefit to attacking 
        enemy provinces. Not only do you get the use of the territory, your opponent 
        is deprived of its income and many improvements that he has built there. 
        Taking a province actually shifts the balance of power by &quot;two provinces’ 
        worth&quot; in favour of the conqueror (plus one for the conqueror, minus 
        one for the defeated party), and may open up further strategic opportunities 
        to divide an enemy’s domain. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">One of the other nice things 
        about capturing a province is that you also capture any castle that happens 
        to be there. As you’ve already seen, though, it’s not necessarily a fast 
        or easy process to capture a castle. You’ll either need to fight at least 
        two battles or starve the garrison into submission through a protracted 
        siege. Naturally, the castle itself will be damaged in the process of 
        being captured (it will be reduced by one level, in fact), but this is 
        often much cheaper than having to build a new structure from scratch. 
        Any military structures associated with the castle will also be captured, 
        unless the castle itself is no longer prestigious enough to be a home 
        for them. Thus, taking a province can also slow or cripple an enemy’s 
        war production too and give your own production capacity an almost-instant 
        boost too!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="4"><b><i>Improving Provinces</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In addition to being great 
        commanders, the daimyo were also great landowners. They had to be, as 
        maintaining an army in the field was a hugely expensive proposition. Like 
        all sensible landlords, the daimyo kept an eye on their holdings and regularly 
        invested in schemes to increase their worth and, in the process, the taxes 
        that they could raise from a province.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>, 
        you can also improve provinces by spending <i>koku </i>on them. Any province 
        can have its farmlands upgraded at least once (and up to four times in 
        most cases) to produce more annual revenue. Provinces with mineral wealth 
        can also have mines built in them. There’s nothing quite as useful as 
        finding gold or other mineral riches in your domain! This was what allowed 
        the Takeda clan to be so mild in their taxes and yet build up a substantial 
        cavalry army.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="4"><b><i>Watchtowers &amp; Border 
        Forts</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There are two &quot;non-economic&quot; 
        improvements that a daimyo can make in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>. 
        Firstly, he can build a watchtower in any province that he controls. This 
        doesn’t help defend the province, but it does act as a permanent spy in 
        all the adjacent provinces. Secondly, he can build a border fort, which 
        acts as a permanent counterspy in the province where it is built. This 
        stops enemy spies from obtaining any information about the province. Watchtowers 
        and border forts also help improve the loyalty of the local peasants.</font></p>

              and make landfall with damaging effects in coastal provinces. However, 
              the western coast of Japan faces China and the seas there simply 
              aren’t big enough for these storms to really get going. As a result, 
              the western coastal provinces are safe from any typhoons. </font></p>

        Peasant Revolts &amp; Ronin</a> </font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="5"><a href="#top"><img src="art/up.gif" width="30" height="14" border="0"></a></font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Not all provinces in the 
        game are actually commanded by one of the daimyo. Just as in the historical 
        Japan, there are provinces where the <i>Ikko-ikki </i>have kicked out 
        their overlords, or where more generalised peasant revolts have taken 
        place. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Every province in <b><i>Shogun 
        Total War </i></b>has a loyalty rating. This measures how the peasants 
        and ji-samurai feel towards their current ruler, and it can be affected 
        by a number of factors. Nothing is likely to cause more damage to loyalty 
        in the long run than consistently high taxes. It’s a great way to raise 
        income, but keeping the tax rate too high can lead to unrest. After the 
        arrival and spread of Christianity, religion can also have an effect on 
        the people’s loyalty, as you’ll see in a later section. Rebellions also 
        have a nasty tendency to spread if left unchecked, as peasants in one 
        province will see that their near neighbours are getting away with rebelling 
        and try it themselves. Just to make life difficult, peasants can sometimes 
        rebel if their harvests have been poor or a natural disaster has struck. 
        After all, it is better from their point of view to keep all of a poor 
        harvest and face a daimyo’s wrath than starve to death after handing over 
        most of a poor harvest in taxes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">At the same time, there are 
        things that a daimyo can and will do to make his provinces happier with 
        his leadership. On the military front, keeping a garrison in a province 
        helps suppress some disloyalty, and is very useful in itself as a &quot;tripwire&quot; 
        force should any of your neighbours decide to invade. Shinobi can also 
        be used as &quot;secret policemen&quot; to weed out malcontents in a province 
        and suppress dissent as well. Border forts and watchtowers will also make 
        the peasants feel better about their lot: at least they can see that their 
        taxes are being spent on something to protect them, and not just on a 
        daimyo’s fancy army. Likewise, spending money to make the peasant’s lives 
        better in the long run by improving their farms also makes a daimyo popular. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There’s also one other factor 
        in whether rebellion breaks out or not: a just-conquered province is likely 
        to rebel and declare loyalty to its former owner if the peasants are given 
        half a chance. Not keeping a garrison force (and possibly a shinobi) in 
        a recently conquered province is likely to cause a revolt. A &quot;change 
        of ownership&quot; takes five years or so to take hold in the hearts and 
        minds of the local population in a province, so bear this in mind when 
        setting tax rates and moving troops around. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Sooner or later, however, 
        it’s likely that someone, somewhere will revolt when you’re playing <b><i>Shogun 
        Total War</i></b>. Depending on the cause of the revolt, it may turn out 
        to be a direct threat or a problem that can be ignored for a little while 
        (but not too long, remembering that rebellion can spread!). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The least dangerous revolt, 
        from a daimyo’s viewpoint, is a peasant rebellion. This causes the ikki 
        in the appropriate province to raise an army of ashigaru spearmen to defend 
        their homes. With a bit of care, a samurai army should be able to crush 
        this kind of rebellion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Religious rebellions are 
        slightly more dangerous, in that they tend to produce better quality field 
        armies of fanatical believers. A rebellion by Christians puts a militant 
        samurai army in the field and these troops are often supported by ashigaru 
        arquebusiers. A Buddhist ikko-ikki revolt, on the other hand, doesn’t 
        have any arquebusiers (as these are a &quot;Christian&quot; weapon), but 
        it can have substantial numbers of warrior monks in its army. In both 
        cases, these can be tricky revolts to put down quickly because of the 
        quality and quantity of the rebel forces involved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Finally, and only in recently 
        conquered provinces, there is the risk that a &quot;loyalist&quot; (to 
        the old daimyo) faction will take control of the province. This can be 
        a double-edged sword, depending upon whether you are the victim of the 
        rebellion or the daimyo for whom the loyalists have declared. If you’re 
        the victim, as soon as a province begins a loyalist revolt, you’ll find 
        yourself facing a new samurai army loyal to the previous daimyo. If you 
        benefit from the loyalist revolt, you’ll suddenly find yourself in a control 
        of a brand new samurai army in your old province!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Finally, after the death 
        of a daimyo (without any heir) his domain doesn’t simply disappear. It 
        dissolves into independent &quot;mini-statelets&quot; under the control 
        of ronin, the daimyo’s former soldiers. These soldiers might look like 
        rebels, but they are actually self-interested warriors only after extending 
        their own powers. They can be among the most dangerous &quot;independent&quot; 
        forces in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>, but fortunately the ronin don’t 
        tend to be that co-ordinated in their actions. The ronin in each province 
        will generally act in selfishly and not come to the aid of any neighbouring 
        ronin who are currently being attacked.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Society of Jesus — the Jesuits 
              — had been formed in Europe as &quot;soldiers of the Counter-Reformation&quot;

              only a militant order, but were often superb scholars, consummate 
              diplomats and very occasionally good soldiers as well. Jesuits were 
              often involved in journeys of exploration simply because they made 
              such superb papal representatives. In Japan their martial spirit 
              was immediately appealing to the samurai, and this was a legacy 
              from their founder, Ignatius Loyola, who had been a military man.

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Christianity, however, demanded 
      that other belief systems be put aside, and the old compromises were not 
      acceptable to true believers. As a result, friction grew up between the 
      followers of the new religion and the more militant elements of the older

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In <b><i>Shogun Total War

        has an easier time in ruling (and collecting taxes from) a predominantly

        own benefits: becoming a Christian daimyo gives easier access to guns 
        earlier in the game (at least until the arrival of the Dutch traders, 
        who don’t care about much except a man’s gold). Remaining as a Buddhist 
        allows fanatical and skilled warrior monks to be used in a daimyo’s armies.

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In either case, the majority 
        religious affiliation of a province will tend to drift towards the faith 
        that is &quot;in charge&quot; (i.e. the faith of the province’s daimyo), 
        and be affected by nearby Christian Churches and Buddhist Temples, which 
        influence nearby populations into supporting the appropriate faith. </font></p>

        as was noted earlier, it’s quite possible for religious differences between

        been constructed with the need to withstand earthquakes in mind. The wooden 
        construction used for traditional buildings was a sensible and practical

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">This isn’t to say that stone 
        buildings didn’t exist in Japan. Stone construction came about as a response 
        to the arrival of gunpowder on a large scale. As in the rest of the world, 
        Japanese castles began as purely defensive structures and only gradually 
        became homes as well as fortresses. Over the years castles became increasingly 
        elaborate as military tactics developed. The best of the Japanese castles 
        built at the end of the Sengoku period were certainly the equal — if not 
        the superior in terms of comfort and facilities — of any fortresses in 
        the rest of the world at the time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Before rockets and cannon 
        arrived in Japan, the main method of attacking a castle was to shoot fire

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i><b>Shogun Total War </b></i>doesn't 
        include the battles that arose from siege warfare because the long, slow 
        business of laying siege to a castle doesn’t make a very exciting game. 
        Sieges are covered in the strategic game in a straightforward fashion 
        so that you don’t have to worry about the details. Siege warfare was often 
        neither heroic nor dramatic. In fact, most of the time it was a pretty 
        squalid affair. If you want to imagine what a siege would have been like, 
        think the most overcrowded camping holiday you’ve ever had or heard about, 
        with utterly dreadful food, no toilets, no reliable fresh water, constant 
        bad weather, no chance to wash for weeks on end and no chance to move 
        somewhere more interesting. Now add in random bouts of illness (caused 
        by the food, bad water, bad weather, lack of hygiene and overcrowding) 
        and random episodes of small-scale violence when the people you are besieging 
        try to kill you or you try to break in and kill them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Of course, none of the intricacies 
        (and boredom) of siege warfare mattered on many occasions. At Osaka in 
        1615, for example (and at other sieges), the troops inside the castle 
        left the protection of the walls to fight it out with the enemy on an 
        open battlefield. Sometimes this was a good move, breaking the siege in 
        one climactic action. At other times, such as Osaka Castle, it simply 
        meant the defenders were cut down outside the walls rather than being 
        starved or slaughtered within them.</font></p>

              used by samurai and ashigaru troops, but these weapons were copied 
              from the samples provided by European traders. In addition, European 
              gunpowder was regarded as being superior to the locally produced 
              item, which means that a Trading Post is a very useful asset for 
              an ambitious daimyo to have in his lands.</font></p>

      Catholicism as &quot;part of the package&quot;. As a largely Protestant

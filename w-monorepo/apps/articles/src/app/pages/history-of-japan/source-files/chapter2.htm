            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The samurai are the defining image 
              of medieval Japan, and for many they still represent Japan. They 
              are widely seen as being the ultimate warriors, ready to charge 
              into danger at a moment’s notice, ready to kill themselves when 
              events went against them, loyal to the point of death and completely 
              unforgiving towards their enemies. As with any stereotype, though, 
              this image of the samurai is both right and wrong. As it turned 
              out many were equally ready to rebel when they thought they could 
              get away with it!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Japanese history shows, for centuries 
              the samurai had been changing from their position as the military 
              servants of &quot;the great and the good&quot; and had increasingly 
              become &quot;the great and the good&quot; themselves. What could 
              be <i>held</i> by the power of the sword could also be <i>taken 
              </i>by the power of the sword. The samurai became the people with 
              power who mattered in affairs of Japan. </font></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2">And this group is where most of the great clans 
      and the <i>daimyo </i>were drawn from. The daimyo were not a separate class 
      of great landowners in society, cut off from everyone else by wealth and 
      privilege. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They were the oldest, the most &quot;noble&quot; 
        or simply the most ruthless among many samurai families. Without military 
        backing, by the time of the Ashikaga shogunate and the Sengoku period, 
        no daimyo could hold on to his lands. At the same time, the daimyo had 
        to worry that one of his followers would one day try to rebel … In theory, 
        however, samurai were supposed to follow a code of honour. Many — indeed 
        most of them — did so to the point of death. This code was called <i>bushido</i>, 
        &quot;the way of the warrior&quot;. </font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="5"><a name="bushido"><font color="#000000">Bushido: 
        The Way of the Warrior</font></a> <a href="#top"><img src="art/up.gif" width="30" height="14" border="0"></a></font></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Today is victory 
        over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.&quot;</b></font></i></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Miyamoto Musashi, The 
        Book of Five Rings, The Water Book</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bushido, as a code of principles, existed 
        from the very start of the samurai. It was only towards the end of the 
        Sengoku period and at the start of the Tokugawa shogunate that the &quot;rules&quot; 
        came to be written down. The purpose of bushido was much the same as the 
        &quot;rules&quot; of medieval chivalry: it gave warriors a set of ideas 
        to live by, elevating them above the normal run of hired killers. Rectitude, 
        endurance, frugality, courage, politeness, veracity, and, especially, 
        loyalty were all-important as virtues for a samurai who truly followed 
        the code of bushido. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As long as a samurai was true to his calling, 
        he retained honour. This obsession with honour at all costs allowed samurai 
        to carry out acts of seemingly wasteful self-sacrifice. A samurai who 
        was surrounded by enemies and still advanced into the middle of them was 
        not, according to the code of bushido, throwing away his life. He was 
        demonstrating that his loyalty was truly sincere. And this is where bushido 
        can look odd or even suicidal to modern eyes. It wasn’t at all. It was 
        no &quot;odder&quot; than European ideas of chivalry. A samurai imbued 
        with a true sense of bushido didn’t think about his own life at all when 
        considering his actions. Life and death were quite incidental to any outcome, 
        providing the act carried out was the right thing to do. Trying and dying 
        in the process was more worthy than not trying at all, because the attempt 
        had been made without concern for the personal consequences. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This didn’t stop some samurai from running 
        away in battle (they were only human, after all), but it should also be 
        clear that bushido simply didn’t mean fighting to the bitter end regardless 
        of any odds either. A samurai was expected to act intelligently as well 
        as bravely and simply throwing your life away wasn’t only wrong, it was 
        foolish. Acts of apparent suicide — such as the fairly regular occurrence 
        of a castle garrison opening the gates and charging the enemy — need to 
        be looked at from the perspective of bushido. Charging an enemy besieging 
        your castle may be personally suicidal, but if it delays the enemy and 
        allows your lord to eventually beat the enemy, it is an act driven by 
        loyalty and bravery, not by a self-destructive impulse. This is what the 
        last 200 Tokugawa defenders at Fushimi Castle did in 1600 when they opened 
        their gates and repeatedly charged the whole Western army! This, of course, 
        is also an explanation for the suicidal <i>banzai </i>charges made during 
        the Second World War by Japanese garrisons on islands all across the Pacific. 
        The code of bushido survived into the 20<sup>th</sup> century in the Imperial 
        Army and Navy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bushido, like all formalised codes of conduct, 
        could also have a dark side to it. Samurai often treated prisoners harshly 
        because the captives had failed to live up to the code of bushido. Many 
        enemies were executed right after battles for just this reason. Unlike 
        Medieval Europe, where it was accepted that a captive nobleman or knight 
        would be held for ransom (often for years), Japanese warfare never really 
        developed a similar system of cash-for-prisoners. A samurai or daimyo 
        taken alive on the battlefield would generally expect to die ignominiously 
        at the hands of his captors. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The books on bushido that have survived from 
        the Sengoku period and later years fall into three basic categories. Some 
        are general &quot;how-to&quot; manuals of weapons handling, where bushido 
        is largely reduced to a practical set of skills. The book <i>Tanki Yoriaki 
        </i>(literally, &quot;A Single Horseman&quot;) is a work from 1735 that 
        concentrates on arming a samurai before battle. The subtitle is <i>Hi 
        Ko Ben </i>or &quot;The Art of Armour Wearing&quot; and it explains exactly 
        what the book is about. Although written long after the Sengoku period, 
        the inherent conservatism of the Tokugawa shogunate means that the techniques 
        described in it were still perfectly valid after more than a century.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Others are philosophical works where the 
        mindset of combat is applied to the wider world so that the ideas and 
        theory of bushido can be used to achieve anything. The third category 
        are the practical and mundane notes for running a castle and an army of 
        samurai, but they also throw light on how bushido was expected to apply 
        to everyday life for samurai. The command of Kato Kiyomasa that &quot;A 
        samurai who practices dancing… should be ordered to commit hara-kiri…&quot; 
        looks a little harsh, but perhaps Kiyomasa had his reasons. Perhaps he 
        wasn’t a very good dancer, or just felt that it was a warrior’s task to 
        devote his energy to the martial arts rather than the cultural ones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That said the &quot;complete samurai&quot; 
        was expected to be a cultured man as well as a skilled warrior. He was 
        not only expected to be good with a sword, but equally good at more sociable 
        skills, including the tea ceremony and poetry. There was even a specific 
        type of poetry duel that samurai indulged in, sometimes even on the battlefield! 
        One samurai would make up the opening line and it was up to his opponent 
        to reply quickly. Clever puns and allusions were very highly regarded 
        in this game of wits. Japan, of course, was a rather wealthy country, 
        and samurai — being high on the social ladder — had every opportunity 
        to sample the finer things in life. The daimyo, of course, lived the kind 
        of life that would have been recognisable in its opulence by a land magnate 
        of the time anywhere in the world. </font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Hara-Kiri: Death and Honour</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;In all forms of 
        strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday life, 
        and to make your everyday stance your combat stance.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Miyamoto Musashi, The 
        Book of Five Rings, The Water Book</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Formal suicide is not just a Japanese idea. 
        The Roman Emperors, for example, often allowed conspirators against them 
        to commit suicide and so preserve their family’s fortune: being ordered 
        to die by your own hand was punishment enough.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But among the samurai, things were slightly 
        different. Death by your own hand was a legitimate way of keeping honour, 
        as well as a punishment. Samurai often killed themselves to avoid capture, 
        or because their lord had died and they wished to show their utter devotion. 
        There was also the curious (to outside eyes) practice of samurai killing 
        themselves to protest against a decision that their liege lord had taken. 
        This was seen as the height of loyalty even if the lord in question took 
        no notice of the act, although it was a rare man who didn’t reconsider 
        his actions when a retainer had chosen to kill himself rather than obey 
        an order. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It should be immediately obvious that hara-kiri 
        or &quot;cutting the belly&quot; is intensely painful, and is <i>intended 
        </i>to be so. The victim was expected to cut his stomach open with more 
        than one stroke. Self-disembowelment was so horrible that the samurai 
        eventually modified the act so that it became a simple stabbing carried 
        out by the victim. Once the first cut had been made a friend or trusted 
        retainer would immediately deliver a mercy blow and cut off the victim’s 
        head. Although the deathblow was merciful, the first cut still required 
        enormous self-discipline from the person committing hara-kiri.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hara-kiri wasn’t the only form that formal 
        suicide took in Japan. Togo Shigechika, for example, is a figure from 
        samurai legend as much as from history, but his death was singularly grisly! 
        Having vainly attacked an enemy fortress, he was buried alive — fully 
        armoured and on horseback — while swearing ghostly vengeance upon his 
        foes!</font></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2">Ninja have become staple &quot;bad guys&quot; 
      in martial arts movies, perhaps a little unfairly. In their fashion they 
      were brave and skilful. It is, for example, claimed that ninja could dislocate 
      their limbs to escape from any bindings, that they could kill any target, 
      hide in plain sight and even leave no trail that a man could follow. They 
      also have &quot;Robin Hood&quot; style legends attached to them of protecting 
      peasants and the weak from rapacious overlords. The number of tricks, traps 
      and early warning devices that were incorporated into castles and mansions 
      shows that they were taken seriously as a threat at the time.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One, possibly apocryphal, story shows the 
        level of danger ninja posed to those they targeted for death. We’ve already 
        seen that Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin fought a running series of 
        battles for control of the Kawanakajima plains, but even after five battles 
        nothing had been decided. Uesugi Kenshin however, did not live to enjoy 
        another contest. He was allegedly assassinated. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Naturally, samurai retainers had guarded 
        Uesugi Kenshin night and day, but this didn’t save him. His killer hid 
        himself beneath Kenshin’s privy for several days, waiting in the latrine 
        pit for the right person (or rather, the right bottom) to appear. After 
        several days — days that must have been remarkably smelly and unhealthy 
        — the ninja’s patience was rewarded when Kenshin answered a call of nature. 
        One swift upward thrust was all that was needed to despatch the very surprised 
        warlord! Takeda Shingen may have been the person who commissioned his 
        death, but there were other <i>daimyo </i>with an equal wish to see a 
        rival dead. It’s equally possible that Oda Nobunaga had Kenshin killed, 
        or that his death was from natural causes. Nevertheless, it is significant 
        that a ninja could be credited with his assassination and in such a fashion!</font></p>

              postponed if the successor wasn’t up to the standards of his illustrious

              his former retainers losing their positions and income. Samurai 
              without a master were referred to as <i>ronin</i>, literally &quot;men 
              of the waves&quot;. Most did not wander for long, as there was fierce 
              competition for good warriors among the daimyo. However, it wasn’t 
              entirely unknown for ronin to set themselves up as petty warlords 
              in a province — after all, this was how many of the great daimyo

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Heraldry&quot; in Japan had exactly 
        the same purpose as it did in the West. It was there to make it easy to 
        recognise &quot;who was who&quot; on the battlefield. Wearing armour tends 
        to make people look identical, so some clear means of working out which 
        anonymous armoured figures you should be killing and which ones are your 
        friends was absolutely vital. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin with, armies carried large coloured 
        banners to show family allegiances. But even from the earliest times, 
        the <i>mon</i>, a (usually symbolic) family crest was stencilled onto 
        banners, painted onto armour or displayed on large, fixed wooden shields. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike Western heraldry, the <i>design </i>of 
        a mon was more important than its colour. It also didn’t change once adopted 
        by a family. In European heraldry the division of a coat of arms into 
        halves, quarters and the like often showed the parentage of the owner. 
        Likewise, the design would be modified by a first, second or third son, 
        making the whole business of heraldry very complicated indeed. In Japan, 
        all members of a single family and all their retainers used the same mon. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By the Sengoku period, the use of mon by 
        samurai families had become firmly established. The Tokugawa clan used 
        the aoi (a hollyhock) in a three-leaf design in a circle. Several families 
        used the same variation on the tomoe (the comma shape used in yin and 
        yang symbols). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mon were used on the <i>sashimono </i>flags 
        worn on the back of individual samurai and ashigaru. The background colour 
        of the flag indicated which army unit the wearer belonged to. Famous (or 
        perhaps just overly proud) samurai sometimes had their names emblazoned 
        on their sashimono rather than a clan symbol. They were also clearly displayed 
        on the <i>nobori</i>, banners carried by standard bearers attached to 
        units. The nobori was a long vertical flag that had a rigid crosspiece 
        along the top. The mon would be stencilled on to the flag near the top. 
        Other nobori for a unit might carry an appropriate motto.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Battle flags carried for units and the entire 
        army could also include inspirational messages rather than just a drawing. 
        One of the flags used by Tokugawa Ieyasu carried the Buddhist slogan &quot;Renounce 
        this filthy world and attain the Pure Land.&quot; The text of the battle 
        flag carried by Takeda Shingen’s troops is quoted in full elsewhere in 
        this manual. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The sheer number of flags and banners carried 
        by a samurai army could be impressive in itself. Every soldier could have 
        his own sashimono. His unit would have one or more nobori flags, and there 
        were also other banners, streamers, flags and simple extravagant insignia 
        carried by the army. <i>Fukinuki</i>, for example, were brightly coloured 
        and boldly designed cylindrical streamers on circular frames: they were 
        almost the same as modern windsocks!</font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Armour</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai did not wear plate armour in the 
        European or mainland Asian style. Armour had been brought from China but 
        instead samurai armour came to be made of small plates held together by 
        silk or leather cords. Originally designed for mounted use the armour, 
        called <i>yoroi</i>, weighed around 30 kilos and was quite effective for 
        a horseman. The wearer’s shoulders carried nearly all the weight and this 
        made the armour a little restrictive when swinging a sword. However, given 
        that the early samurai were largely mounted bowmen, this wasn’t much of 
        a problem. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the Onin War armour began to change 
        so that its weight was more evenly distributed across the torso. This 
        helped when using a sword in particular, as shoulder movements no longer 
        had to work against the weight of the armour as well as the sword. The 
        distinctive lacing was kept, and it required enormous attention in both 
        manufacture and day-to-day care to make it &quot;work&quot; properly. 
        For a country that was covered in paddy fields, having armour held together 
        with laces might seem a little odd. The laces themselves would become 
        waterlogged quite easily, and therefore very heavy. In cold weather, they 
        could easily freeze. They did, however, mean that the armour was flexible, 
        easy to wear and relatively easy to repair. Coloured laces also made it 
        easy to identify armies and individual units belonging to specific clans 
        on the battlefield, in exactly the same way as any other uniform does. 
        In the confusion of hand-to-hand fighting, being able to spot your allies 
        and your enemies quickly is rather important!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is this lacing that makes Japanese armour 
        so colourful and attractive to the modern eye. The samurai were naturally 
        practical about their armour. The samurai didn’t always approve of colourful 
        displays just for the sake of looking good. Apart from anything else, 
        some dyes weakened the silk and made the laces fall to pieces, which largely 
        defeats the point of using them to hold armour together.</font></p>

              after 1570 jet-black dye became available and black-laced armour 
              became popular. Armour, above all, was an important &quot;tool of 
              the trade&quot; as far as the samurai were concerned, being there 
              to keep the wearer alive in the very hostile environment on a battlefield!

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai armour was made of many pieces 
              that could be worn individually. The plates themselves were often 
              cleverly manufactured with more than one layer to them: a backing 
              of soft iron to absorb impacts, a harder steel face and finally 
              layers of lacquer to stop rusting. The sectional nature of the armour 
              meant, for example, there was no need for a samurai who was just 
              on guard duty at his master’s mansion to wear full armour. He could 
              manage for this task by simply using armoured sleeves beneath his 
              everyday clothes. These flexible sleeves were made of small plates 
              sown into silk or leather coverings, and worn with shoulder cords 
              to hold them in place. Likewise, when an attack wasn’t expected 
              he could still wear some armour (in camp, say) and save putting 
              on the heavier pieces until absolutely necessary.</font><br>

      <font face="Arial" size="2">Putting on full armour involved a set ritual 
      specifying a hand, leg or arm to be covered first. Apart from anything else, 
      the ritual served a practical purpose in making sure that the samurai and 
      his servants didn’t forget any part of the process. It also helped in organising 
      the armour so that the pieces put on later always overlapped the underlying, 
      earlier bits. As a result, the protection was maximised because any blow 
      would be deflected away from the wearer by a series of glancing surfaces 
      that started at the samurai’s shoulders and went all the way down his body. 
      There was little that stuck out from the armour for a blow to catch on and 
      lead a blade in towards the samurai beneath. </font> 
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai helmets almost defy description. 
        They could be enormous and frightening, ornate and completely &quot;over 
        the top&quot;. They carried antlers, enormous crests, horns, huge feathers 
        and sunbursts, suns and anything else to make the wearer more intimidating 
        and impressive. The heraldic mon was also a favourite device on helmets. 
        Added to this stunning effect, protective masks were often terrifying 
        renderings of demonic faces, or deliberately grotesque &quot;cartoons&quot; 
        of the samurai under the mask! Few daimyo went quite as far as Date Masamune 
        who gave his entire <i>hatamoto </i>(bodyguard unit) of 200 men gold-lacquered, 
        pointed helmets that almost doubled the height of their wearers!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s worth remembering, though, that some 
        of the extremely decorative armours and helmets that still survive would 
        never have been worn near a battlefield. A samurai who could afford it 
        (or a daimyo who could afford it for his men) would have almost certainly 
        equipped them with down-to-earth battlefield gear and other decorative, 
        ceremonial dress as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the arrival of the Portuguese there 
        was also a fashion for &quot;Christian&quot; armour among the samurai. 
        In fact, this &quot;Christian&quot; armour was a Spanish pattern and, 
        it can be argued, not as technologically advanced as Japanese armour of 
        the same period. Even so, there are illustrations of samurai using European 
        armour. This, perhaps, was a fashion statement as much as a practical 
        decision, perhaps to show that the wearer was extremely wealthy (armour 
        carried all the way from Europe was always going to be expensive!) and 
        perhaps as an open mark of a new Christian faith. Surviving examples of 
        European armour from this period nearly always have a bullet mark somewhere 
        on the breastplate. This doesn’t mean that the wearer was shot, but that 
        a bullet had been fired at the armour to test it. The dent was left to 
        show the customer that the gunfire test on his new armour had been successful.

      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Ashigaru Armour</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many ashigaru soldiers were often issued 
        with standardised armour and weapons by the clan they served (ashigaru 
        had to provide a sword for themselves). To give them a uniform appearance 
        coloured lacquer was often used on the iron plates, and the clan heraldic 
        mon would often be painted on the chest and back plates too. Of far cheaper 
        construction than samurai armour, ashigaru armour was nevertheless a good 
        compromise between protection and mobility, and much better than the equivalent 
        peasant in a European army of the time would have been given.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ashigaru helmets were almost always the same 
        low conical <i>jingasa</i>, a practical bit of gear that, when turned 
        upside down over a fire, could be used as a rice boiler. </font></p>

        Book of Five Rings, The Wind Book</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Sengoku</i> period was a pretty lawless 
        one. Even peasants habitually went armed with all kinds of weapons. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai were the only people allowed to carry 
        two swords, a pair called the <i>daisho</i>, (the &quot;long and short&quot;) 
        as a badge of their unique warrior status. These two weapons, the long 
        <i>katana </i>and the shorter <i>wakizashi</i>, were worn together although 
        rarely used as a pair of weapons in combat. Miyamoto Musashi, the sword-saint 
        and writer of the best-known book on swordsmanship, <i>A Book of Five 
        Rings</i>, was unusual in that his &quot;Two Heavens&quot; fighting style 
        did use two swords at the same time. One other sword is worth mentioning 
        at this point, the <i>no dachi</i>. These enormous two-handed weapons 
        were only ever used on foot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The samurai used the katana to defend as 
        well as attack and as a result never adopted shields, unlike the knights 
        of Europe. They never needed to, because of the superb metalwork in the 
        katana was good enough to act in both capacities. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A samurai sword was carefully constructed 
        out of many layers of steel and iron. The two would be hammered out and 
        folded over many times to produce a &quot;sandwich&quot; of many layers. 
        Each repeated forging doubled the number of layers of metal in a sword, 
        in some cases 2²º — 4,194,304 — layers of metal would be the result. The 
        maximum number of folds recorded is some 2³º (or 10,736,461,824!) layers 
        of forged metal. This gave the sword enormous strength when the iron and 
        steel were welded together. The iron at the sides and back edge gave flexibility 
        to the blade, while the steel core could be hardened to make a perfect 
        edge. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final process in the forging was particularly 
        clever. The blade was coated with clay built up to a different thickness 
        across the blade: thin at the cutting edge and thick towards the back. 
        When the sword — in its clay overcoat — was heated and then quenched, 
        it cooled at different speeds and the metal crystals in each part in the 
        blade ended up as different sizes. They were large where the clay had 
        been thick, which meant that they were flexible, but small at the cutting 
        edge, so they would form a hard edge that could be sharpened. Once the 
        sword blade was polished, the change from the softer steel and the harder 
        edge could show up as the <i>yakiba</i>, a line that resembles a breaking 
        wave. Once the blade had been signed by the smith and hilt and guard fitted, 
        the sword was ready for use. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The result of all of this was a sword that 
        could cut a man in two — literally. Occasionally condemned criminals were 
        used to test new swords, but it was more common to use a bundle of rushes 
        and bamboo or to use corpses. Some swords had details of their testing 
        carved into the tang (the piece of the sword inside the hilt). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks to the resilience of such a blade, 
        a samurai could block and turn blows that would have shattered any ordinary 
        steel weapon. Its razor sharp edge gave him the ability to cut through 
        an opponent right down to the bone. These two contrasting qualities were 
        the result of the skills and experience that Japanese sword smiths had 
        accumulated over centuries. No other sword, even the famous blades from 
        Toledo in Spain, ever equalled these Japanese weapons. The katana is still 
        probably the best hand-to-hand weapon ever produced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A sword became the &quot;soul of samurai&quot; 
        who carried it and many became family heirlooms. As late as the Second 
        World War some officers had their family blades placed in army-issue fittings 
        then carried them into action. Officers’ swords that were carried home 
        by Allied soldiers as war souvenirs from Pacific battlefields are still 
        occasionally identified as ancient, incredibly valuable blades even today.

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Archery was the skill that the early samurai 
        prized above all others, even more than swordsmanship. They even used 
        the term &quot;The Way of Horse and Bow&quot; to describe their military 
        calling. This dates back to the time when samurai were primarily cavalry 
        soldiers and fought as mounted archers. Over the centuries two slow evolutions 
        took place so that cavalry became primarily armed with spears and many 
        other samurai took to fighting as foot soldiers. Using the bow well, however, 
        remained the mark of a well-trained and disciplined warrior.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A samurai bow looks ungainly as the handgrip 
        is not central, but two-thirds of the distance along the bow, with the 
        longer section above the handgrip. This odd appearance was quite deliberate, 
        because it allowed a much more powerful bow to be easily used from horseback. 
        The short lower section could easily be swung across a horse’s neck so 
        that the samurai could fire at any target. A symmetrical bow would have 
        been smaller (and therefore less powerful) or been ungainly for mounted 
        use. The bow itself was carefully laminated from deciduous wood and bamboo 
        and then bound for extra strength. The whole thing was carefully lacquered 
        to keep out damp. Stringing a bow could take the combined effort of several 
        men, so the whole bow had enormous power. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The level of skill that a samurai archer 
        could achieve was the product of long years of practice. Samurai were 
        expected to hit small targets while riding at full gallop. This is a skill 
        that is still demonstrated today at <i>yamasame </i>festivals. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arrows came in many types, but the most unusual 
        were signalling arrows that had a large wooden whistle fitted to the head. 
        These made a warbling noise as they flew through the air and were fired 
        at the start of battle to attract the attention of <i>kami</i>, or spirits, 
        to witness the brave deeds that were about to be performed. Fire arrows 
        were also popular, particularly during sieges.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The naginata looks remarkably like a quarterstaff 
        with a large sword blade fixed to one end. The sohei warrior monks particularly 
        favoured them, but in the hands of a skilled man (which is to say a samurai) 
        they were devastating against almost any opponent. During the Sengoku 
        period the naginata fell out of widespread use as the yari became a popular 
        weapon with the clans. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As with all Japanese weapons, skilled craftsmen 
        often made yari. The yari’s shaft was often of oak, surrounded by bamboo 
        laminations and then whole covered with weatherproof lacquer. A razor-sharp 
        blade completed the spear. Originally, the yari was about 3 or 4 metres 
        in length, but as the Sengoku period continued, it became longer as the 
        daimyo experimented with its tactical use. The Date family, for example, 
        equipped their men with 5.4 metre (around 18 feet) yari. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The daimyo came to see the yari as a valuable 
        &quot;offensively&quot; defensive weapon, the theory being that enemy 
        warriors couldn’t get into close combat past a row of sharp blades at 
        the end of a long spear. Different clans also standardised on different 
        lengths for their yari; for example, those used by Oda clan spearmen were 
        also well over five metres long. This was partly thanks to their use as 
        a &quot;shelter&quot; for arquebus-armed troops, who needed yari-armed 
        comrades to keep the enemy at bay while they reloaded.</font></p>

      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;Defence is for 
        times of insufficiency. Attack is for times of surplus.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The arquebus or firelock is almost as simple 
        as firearms get. Powder, wadding and a ball are rammed home down the barrel, 
        the touchhole is primed and then a smouldering cord, the match, sets off 
        the weapon. Unlike very early handguns, where the match was simply held 
        in the gunner’s hand, the match on an arquebus was held by a short arm-like 
        lever and flipped into place at the touchhole when the trigger is pulled. 
        There’s no flint or other relatively complicated sparking mechanism to 
        go wrong. What could go wrong was that the arquebus could explode in the 
        face of the user (although this wasn’t too common), or that damp could 
        get into the powder, making the weapon an expensive club. As a result, 
        an army armed with arquebuses was dependent on having good weather on 
        a battle day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All that said, once they had been introduced 
        to the arquebus, the daimyo and their samurai retainers recognised its 
        usefulness almost immediately. After 1542 it took very little time for 
        local craftsmen to start making them for the samurai. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many samurai carried the arquebus in battle, 
        and used it to snipe (with mixed success, given the inherent inaccuracy 
        of a smoothbore weapon) at important enemies. However, it was never the 
        primary weapon of a true samurai. That remained the sword. As a weapon 
        for individual (and in the early years, wealthy) samurai, it was never 
        going to be truly effective in the hands of just a few samurai. Apart 
        from anything else, it was usually good for just one shot because there 
        was rarely chance to reload on the battlefield, even with servants to 
        help. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The weapon’s true utility came when it was 
        used by massed ranks of ashigaru. In modern terms, great numbers of arquebuses 
        made up for the weakness of the individual weapon by turning it into a 
        weapons system. When firing as a single mass or volley firing, larger 
        units overcame the fact that the arquebus — like all early firearms — 
        was hugely inaccurate and slow. It was more by luck than judgement that 
        an arquebusier could hit a man-sized target at 50 metres or so. Beyond 
        100 metres, anyone struck by a ball from an arquebus was unlucky rather 
        than a victim of deliberate fire. By mass firing against massed targets, 
        these limitations were overcome and the weapon system that resulted changed 
        Japanese warfare. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The effects of an arquebus wound, once the 
        target was hit, could be very nasty indeed. The large shot fired (around 
        25mm in diameter) were hand cast, and as a result were often flawed. A 
        hand-cast lead bullet could quite easily break up once it had entered 
        the target and cause very severe injuries. Arquebus bullets also travelled 
        relatively slowly, so that nearly all their energy was delivered <i>into 
        </i>the target, giving rise to shock effects as well. It was not uncommon 
        for people hit in the arms or legs to die from the shock of the wound. 
        By contrast, a modern bullet travels much faster and will sometimes pass 
        through its target completely. Not as much of its energy will dissipate 
        into the person who has been hit, nor will it shatter into pieces on entry.

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like the best armies have always been, a 
        samurai army was a &quot;combined arms&quot; force. It included cavalry, 
        missile troops and infantry (in varying proportions, depending upon the 
        clan in question) to act in concert on the battlefield.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the Sengoku period progressed, the ashigaru 
        became an increasingly important part of every clan army. On one level, 
        this was inevitable: the simple need for fighters meant that the samurai 
        had to be supplemented in some fashion! But the samurai had never gone 
        into battle alone anyway. From the very earliest times, servants had attended 
        each samurai. These servants (<i>genin </i>or <i>shoju</i>) acted as his 
        &quot;support team&quot;, ready to bring him the right weapon at the right 
        time, re-supply him with arrows, and even count his conquests. </font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Avoiding confrontation 
        with orderly ranks and not attacking great formations is mastering adaptation. 
        The rule for military operations is not to face a high hill and not to 
        oppose those with their backs to a hill.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No matter who fought with them, it was the 
        samurai that eventually decided the course of a battle. It was traditional 
        for samurai to advance into a fight shouting out their names and looking 
        for a worthy opponent. When a samurai found one, he would engage him in 
        single combat. The winner would move on, and his defeated foe would be 
        beheaded. The head would be tagged so that everyone knew exactly who claimed 
        the kill. At the end of the battle the victorious general would inspect 
        all the heads and reward his followers according to their individual prowess 
        — but woe betide any samurai who accidentally killed an ally! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All of this led to many battles that were 
        mass brawls rather than organised affairs. Brave samurai would be quite 
        willing to charge into the ranks of the enemy looking for opponents to 
        kill in the hopes of gaining recognition. Indeed, some individuals came 
        to see it as a right that they should advance and look for a worthy opponent, 
        regardless of any battle plan their generals might happen to be considering. 
        This enthusiasm could be a dubious benefit from the point of view of a 
        general: it was sometimes impossible to restrain headstrong troops from 
        attacking the enemy. More than one plan was ruined because the samurai 
        decided to take the fight to the enemy without thought of the consequences.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nevertheless, under the right commanders 
        a samurai army was a formidable instrument of war. It could be difficult 
        to manage at times, but it was also a war winner.</font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Tactics</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;When the enemy 
        presents openings, penetrate immediately. Get what they want, subtly anticipate 
        them. Maintain discipline and adapt to the enemy to determine the war’s 
        outcome. At first you are like a maiden so that the enemy opens his door; 
        then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so the enemy cannot keep you 
        out.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All daimyo made use of their army’s best 
        features in battle. The Takeda clan, for example, was fond of beginning 
        with a cavalry charge. Their mounted samurai were among the best in the 
        country, and this simple tactic exploited that fact. It worked well, for 
        the most part, until they chose to charge across waterlogged ground towards 
        Nobunaga’s arquebusiers at the Battle of Nagashino (1575). That day the 
        Takeda clan learned that warfare had changed. The Nobunaga clan, as might 
        be expected, used their arquebusiers to good effect and slaughtered their 
        bogged-down enemies. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The important thing for any army was to attack 
        as small a part of the enemy with as many of its own samurai as possible. 
        Although ashigaru made up the bulk of a clan army by a head count, it 
        was the samurai who were the &quot;arm of decision&quot; in most battles. 
        No ashigaru force could be expected to stand up to the same number of 
        samurai in a straight fight. The samurai ethos of warfare and his superior 
        training counted for too much. After all, a samurai had been trained for 
        warfare almost from the time that he could walk. The chances were that 
        an ashigaru had chosen the life of a soldier as an easier option to endless 
        toil in a rice paddy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the most part, the great general of the 
        Sengoku period, Oda Nobunaga wasn’t a formal tactician, but he did understand 
        that discipline, drill and training were vital in making sure that an 
        army worked together effectively. He also insisted that his soldiers wore 
        easily seen and highly coloured uniforms. These changes in army organisation 
        and practices impressed his opponents at the time. In these simple ideas, 
        he was ahead of many of his contemporaries. </font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Tactics and the Arquebus </font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;When generals cannot 
        assess opponents, clash with much greater numbers or more powerful forces 
        and do not understand the level of skill of their own soldiers, they are 
        beaten.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The arrival of the arquebus and his use of 
        volley fire also gave Oda Nobunaga’s tactical innovations added impetus. 
        A good unit of arquebus-armed troops would be lucky to get off three shots 
        in a minute. It was more likely that the rate of fire would be only two 
        volleys per minute. In between while the ashigaru were busy reloading, 
        enemy warriors could close and engage. And an unloaded arquebus was only 
        useful as a heavy club.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All the daimyo had incorporated ashigaru 
        arquebusiers into their armies but usually everyone in a unit fired at 
        the same time. This could be devastating, but it meant that the unit was 
        effectively useless for the time the gunners were reloading. Nobunaga, 
        on the other hand, made sure that only <i>some </i>of his men fired at 
        any one time. This volley fire was an important innovation in battle practice: 
        by having his soldiers fire in ranks or sections, Nobunaga was able to 
        keep up a steady, continuous fire against the enemy. This made it dangerous 
        to close with his troops because there was no &quot;down time&quot; between 
        shots from the ashigaru.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Japanese armies had also begun to evolve 
        along the same lines as the European &quot;pike and shot&quot; armies 
        of the same period. Spearmen were used to protect the arquebusiers while 
        they reloaded. The tactical solutions that arose weren’t identical in 
        Europe and Japan. The Japanese never, for example, ended up with spearmen 
        (pikes) fighting in units that were 30 or more ranks deep. &quot;Push 
        of pikes&quot;, that huge shoving match that many European battles degenerated 
        into, never became a major part of a samurai battle. The presence of samurai 
        each armed with a katana made sure of that.</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;On level ground 
        take up positions where it is easy to manoeuvre, keeping the higher land 
        to your right rear, with low ground in front and high ground behind.&quot;</font></i></b></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Keeping charge of an army was, at times, 
        remarkably difficult. Flag signals, conch horn signals and drums could 
        carry simple orders to units, but mounted messengers carried difficult 
        instructions to distant units. This was why set battle formations became 
        so important. When every man had a set position in a battle — and this 
        had been repeatedly drilled into him — the need to communicate with subordinates 
        was less pressing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately, from their perspective, Japanese 
        generals rarely had a problem with cowardice in the presence of the enemy. 
        If anyone was likely to &quot;cut and run&quot; under the stress of battle, 
        it would be the ashigaru. A good general made sure that ashigaru were 
        never given the key position in any battle, and that there were troops 
        behind them to bolster their morale, act as a rallying point or just simply 
        kill them if they did choose to run.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Samurai would never voluntarily abandon a 
        fight unless it was truly hopeless and dying served no purpose. Sometimes, 
        this single-minded bravery could be slightly problematic. Samurai were 
        known to break ranks and <i>charge </i>the enemy despite of having orders 
        not to do so, and despite it being pointless. There were times when &quot;running 
        away and living to fight another day&quot; would have been the right thing 
        to do in strategic terms, even if it meant losing a tactical battle. Such 
        pig-headedness, while commendable on one level, could lead to the best-laid 
        plans going awry through foolish dedication rather than failed morale.</font></p>

      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;The victorious

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Getting an army organised on the field of 
        battle was an important drill that every general would have had his troops 
        practice. The process of getting an army out of a marching column and 
        into some kind of battle line was helped because there were standard formations 
        for an army about to enter battle. The following six were recommended 
        battle formations that every army would know how to apply when entering 
        a fight.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All formations were based on older Chinese 
        ideas for deploying armies, and all of them had elements in common. The 
        <i>taisho</i>, or general, was always near the centre of his army, where 
        his command skills could be best used to control his followers. Cavalry 
        — and this meant exclusively samurai — were positioned where they could 
        charge against vulnerable enemy units. A skirmish line of brave samurai 
        and ashigaru missile-armed troops were in a forward position to harass 
        and break up the enemy’s ordered ranks as they approached. Most importantly, 
        there would be a substantial contingent held in the rear as a tactical 
        reserve to be committed at a battle-winning moment. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Ganko</b> — This is a flexible and 
          powerful formation that can quickly change into a defensive pattern 
          called <i>onryo</i> by a series of pre-arranged moves. The units of 
          samurai could be pulled back at an angle to make the second formation.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Gyorin</b> — Effectively this is a 
          &quot;blunt arrowhead&quot; formation similar to the hoshi. Typically, 
          an army that was badly outnumbered by its opponents would use this formation. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hoen</b> — This was a keyhole-shaped 
          formation that was widely regarded as the best counter to the <i>hoshi 
          </i>arrowhead. The enemy drawn into the centre and destroyed in detail.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hoshi</b> — This is an attacking formation, 
          and regarded as one of the strongest. The arrowhead brings the maximum 
          pressure to bear against a small portion of the enemy battle line.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Kakuyoku</b> — This is another strong 
          formation that can be quickly changed to suit the emerging battle situation. 
          As it stands, the <i>kakuyoku </i>is equally good for offence or defence. 
          Without too many movements by the component units, the entire army could 
          be changed into a <i>hoshi </i>and sent against the enemy.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Koyaku</b> — Another flexible formation 
          that, thanks to the split vanguard, is capable of absorbing an enemy 
          initial attack for long enough for the enemy’s true intentions to become 
          plain. Once they were, the army could adapt its tactics to match.</font></li>

        kind or another within the producing clan’s domains. Some units also require 
        that the castle be upgraded with specialist weapon makers or <i>dojo</i> 
        — specialised training establishments.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A clan’s resources must be sufficient to 
        pay the cost of the unit in <i>koku</i>. Some of these units might seem 
        &quot;cheap&quot;, but that’s only until you remember that a <i>koku </i>is 
        the quantity of rice used to feed one man for a whole year. That’s not 
        to say that a unit of light cavalry need several warehouses full of rice 
        to keep them going, but that this is the level of wealth that’s needed 
        to pay for their training and upkeep. Remember that not all the clans 
        necessarily get their money in rice from the peasants. The Takeda were 
        lucky enough to own a gold mine, while other clans made money by taxing 
        trade with the Chinese mainland. Koku, however, are a good standard measure 
        for wealth in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An army is made up of mixture of unit types, 
        simply because each style of fighting has its own strengths and weaknesses. 
        A skilled general takes into account the strengths of each kind of unit 
        while being aware of their weaknesses. By making sure that the weaknesses 
        of one sort of unit are screened or compensated by another unit, a strong 
        army can be built up. </font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Those who use an 
        army skilfully do not raise troops twice and do not provide food three

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The exact mix of units in an army depends 
        on the personal command style of the daimyo in charge. The Takeda clan, 
        for example, used to include quite a high proportion of cavalry in their 
        armies because it was their standard (and often successful!) tactic to 
        begin a battle with a full-blown cavalry charge into the enemy. The shock 
        effect of this cavalry charge often demoralised an opposing force before 
        the real battle began, making victory an easier proposition. The mix of 
        units in your army when playing <b><i>Shogun Total War </i></b>will depend 
        on the tactics that you want to try out, what opponents are fielding against 
        you, and what units you can afford to train.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good <i>taisho</i> also kept his army intact 
        as far as possible. There was little point in winning a battle if the 
        victory has cost too much blood. Because warriors in <b><i>Shogun Total 
        War </i></b>gain experience when they fight, it is a sensible policy to 
        try and keep casualties to a minimum. Units that are bled white in battles 
        not only lose soldiers; they also lose valuable combat effectiveness as 
        the knowledge of how to fight — and win — dies with the warriors who are 
        killed. In the game, building medical establishments does help units recover 
        from casualties, but it is better to avoid them in the first place.</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Getting soldiers 
        to fight by letting the force of momentum work is like rolling rocks or 
        logs… When troops are skilfully led into battle the momentum is like that

      <p align="RIGHT"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, when looking at these different 
        types of soldier, remember that the samurai were the living embodiment 
        of a simple military principle. Weapons are useless unless used well, 
        and the warriors carrying the swords and guns are more important than 
        the weapons they carry. It almost goes without saying that a unit of samurai 
        is much better in terms of quality than any ashigaru force, no matter 
        what their armaments. Both, however, are necessary when building an army 
        because having many &quot;cheaper&quot; men is often useful in battle 
        and in holding ground once it is taken.</font></p>

              attack range than a sword. This makes it a terrible weapon to face: 
              for example, a single sweep from a naginata can neatly decapitate 
              a charging horseman or cripple his horse. In either case, the horseman

      <font face="Arial" size="2">Early arquebuses were very heavy, and often 
      needed a stake-like support for the barrels. In turn, this made them cumbersome 
      to move and deploy, as they certainly couldn’t be used without such supports. 
      This also means that arquebus-armed ashigaru aren’t very effective in hand-to-hand 
      combat. Their firepower can inflict heavy casualties on anyone who comes 
      near, but if the enemy gets close enough, the arquebus-armed ashigaru are 
      at a huge disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat. They will, quite simply, 
      be cut to pieces.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because arquebus-armed ashigaru require a

        be produced <i>after </i>the arrival of European traders in Japan: the 
        Portuguese arrive in 1542, while the Dutch land in 1561. European traders 
        were quite happy to sell guns to the daimyo warlords, but their European 
        gun makers were at the other end of a very long and hazardous sea voyage. 
        Local gunsmiths did manage to copy European arquebuses, but not immediately 
        in large quantities. This is part of the reason for the relatively long 
        training time for arquebus-armed ashigaru. It’s not hard to teach troops

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Throughout Japanese history, warfare nearly 
        always involved castles. <b><i>Shogun Total War</i> </b>includes both 
        castles and the battles that were fought over them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>, you won’t 
        have to sit and watch a long siege, as all the details will be handled 
        for you by the strategic game system. If your forces invade a province 
        with a castle, they will have to fight the province’s garrison as always, 
        but victory doesn’t automatically take control of the province. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead, the defeated defenders retreat into 
        the castle and the province becomes contested by the two daimyo. This 
        stops either side getting any tax income from the province, but it also 
        stops the defender building any new military units there as well. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As long as there is an attacking army in 
        the contested province, the castle is besieged. You, as commander of your 
        clan, don’t have to worry about the details of the siege. As long as the 
        castle is besieged, the defending troops will suffer attrition losses 
        as they starve or your own men conduct small-scale attacks. This is a 
        slow but fairly certain method of taking a castle. Of course, you can 
        always order an assault that will result in another tactical battle or 
        decide that a siege is going to take too long and try a different strategic 
        approach.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It might look like the defenders, on the 
        other hand, have no choice but to sit there and wait to be starved out, 
        but there are options for them too in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>. 
        The first of these is, naturally enough, just to sit there and hope the 
        attackers give up! This may, however, be only postponing the inevitable. 
        The defenders can sally forth and fight it out on the battlefield, but 
        defeat will let the attackers into the castle. Alternately, the defenders 
        can also be aided by another friendly army acting as a relief column to 
        raise the siege. The arrival of a relief column will also trigger another 
        tactical battle in the province.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assuming that the attackers are successful, 
        they will gain control of the castle, but it will have been damaged as 
        a result of the siege. This may mean that some of the castle improvements 
        (as explained later) will not function until the castle is fully repaired. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you can see, castles are hugely useful 
        in slowing down the advance of an attacking army because it will take 
        time to besiege or assault a castle. This is quite apart from the benefits 
        they give to their owners as training grounds for new troop units.</font></p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Historical Castles</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Castles in historical Japan were naturally 
        built to be defensible when under siege, and nearly all the early castles 
        in Japan were built in the most awkward places (for the attacker) that 
        could be found. Early castles were almost always wooden stockades with 
        a few stone reinforcements. Hilltops and even mountaintops were fortified, 
        and the nearby availability of suitable wood and stone undoubtedly helped 
        the builders. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike in Europe, the defenders were lucky 
        in one respect. They never had to worry about lots of siege machines other 
        than battering rams. The techniques of taking a castle were simple and 
        rather brutal: the attacking army surrounded the castle, attempted to 
        burn it down with fire arrows and, at some point, mounted an infantry 
        assault over the walls or against its gate. By and large, the defenders 
        only had to wait out the siege and hope that their enemy would give up 
        as his troops deserted or disease took its toll. Often, however, the defenders 
        didn’t wait around for the attackers to leave. Japanese history is full 
        of accounts of samurai leaving the safety of their castles to take the 
        fight to the enemy, often with mixed results. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By the Sengoku period, castles had been built 
        along the same principles for centuries, and siege techniques hadn’t changed 
        all that much either. After all, there was no real need to change a design 
        that worked. A tradition of building stone castles was never really developed 
        before the Sengoku period, possibly for the good reason that Japan is 
        one huge earthquake zone, but also because it simply wasn’t really necessary. 
        A good set of compromises between wood and stone did eventually emerge, 
        with stone being used to create &quot;artificial hills&quot; on top of 
        which castles were built. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The key feature in castle design, its defence 
        and in siege warfare remained the range of a fire arrow. The ability to 
        burn down a castle was all-important, as was the ability to keep the defenders 
        far enough away from vulnerable internal buildings so that they couldn’t 
        burn them down. All this changed, of course, with the introduction of 
        firearms. Now both defender and attacker had to take into account snipers, 
        as well as larger siege guns, of which there were some in Japan. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One thing didn’t change during the Sengoku 
        period, and that was the same willingness of the defenders to charge out 
        of the castle to meet their enemies on an open field. Given the influence 
        of bushido upon a samurai’s actions, it is less surprising that so many 
        chose to fight in the open than act in a completely defensive fashion! 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some castles of the Sengoku period could 
        be enormous. Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s fortress at Osaka was truly vast, and 
        the equal of any defensive structure in the world at the time. It used 
        the river nearby as part of its defences, and had defensive outer walls 
        some 18 <i>kilometres </i>long. Within, a series of baileys meant that 
        an attacker was forced to besiege one inner wall after another to have 
        any hope of taking the place. </font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Artillery In Japan</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the eyes of a 16<sup>th</sup> or 17<sup>th</sup> 
        century European general one thing would seem to be missing from a samurai 
        army. Where is the field artillery? In Europe, gunpowder weapons were 
        expensive to manufacture and difficult to use, at least when first created, 
        so artillery was in use <i>before </i>handguns became common. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Japan, however, matters were largely reversed. 
        This was thanks to earlier Imperial edicts against wheeled transport of 
        all kinds. Japan had become a society where everyone walked, or rode on 
        horseback or was carried by palanquin. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Without a good, wheeled carriage, it is very 
        nearly impossible (and definitely impractical) to move field guns around 
        open countryside. Try carrying a car’s back axle and transmission across 
        a muddy field while (a) several hundred people try to kill you and (b) 
        you try to keep the whole thing dry and then you’ll have some idea of 
        the practical difficulties of dealing with artillery on a samurai battlefield!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The daimyo took to arquebuses with enthusiasm, 
        but artillery never really got used as a separate &quot;weapon system&quot; 
        for the battlefield. There were large guns but these were used in siege 
        warfare, and changes in castle building techniques mostly kept ahead of 
        artillery practices. This is why large field guns haven’t been included 
        in <b><i>Shogun Total War</i></b>. Artillery pieces just weren’t that 
        significant in Japanese battlefield warfare at this time.</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Naval Forces In Japan</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It would be fair to say that that the samurai 
        were never consummate masters of naval combat, because they never really 
        <i>needed </i>to become expert sailors. A fleet wasn’t going to make its 
        owner the shogun, but a samurai army might just do the job! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Warships were built and used, but they weren’t 
        really a decisive factor in the Sengoku period. As a result, <b><i>Shogun 
        Total War </i></b>doesn’t include naval forces. During the game you can 
        build shipyards in coastal provinces, but these are needed for transport 
        and trade between the main islands of Japan.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Drawn from the ranks of the most able 
              samurai, a taisho is a general given command of part (or all) of 
              a clan’s army. The taisho shows the position of the army on the 
              strategic map of Japan, and he is also present on any battlefield 
              involving units under his command. On a battlefield, a taisho has 
              a small group of bodyguards (his <i>hatamoto</i>) to protect him. 
              A general has an influence on all the units under his command. As 
              he gains honour and experience, the units a taisho commands receive 
              bonuses to their morale. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generals can be killed on the battlefield 
              by enemy troops and they are also vulnerable to ninja assassination 
              attempts. Taisho are definitely assets worth using (and protecting) 
              on the battlefield.</font></p>

              a fine pitch, and they can be trusted to treat daimyo with respect 
              and honour when negotiating with them. Every time an emissary succeeds 
              in a diplomatic mission, his experience increases; this both increases 
              his chances of success in future and makes him slightly less vulnerable

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, there is always the risk that

              result of sending an emissary to see a daimyo is that his head — 
              and <i>just </i>his head — will be sent back! This definitely means

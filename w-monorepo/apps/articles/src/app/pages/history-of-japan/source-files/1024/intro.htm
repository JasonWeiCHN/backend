      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i><b>Shogun Total War </b></i>is 
        set in the <i>Sengoku </i>period of Japanese history. Now, unless you’re 
        a Japanese historian and recognise that this means &quot;The Country at 
        War&quot;, that probably doesn’t mean very much to you. By the time you’re 
        playing the game (and if you’ve read at least some of this manual), you 
        will realise that this is one of the most dramatic and exciting times 
        in the history of Japan. In fact, it’s one of the most dramatic and exciting 
        periods of history anywhere in the world! </font></p>

        The Art of War</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In the space of a little 
        of over one hundred years, samurai armies fought for control of Japan. 
        They were lead by the <i>daimyo,</i> a group of hugely powerful warlords 
        who would have been kings and princes in their own right anywhere else 
        in the world. Some of the daimyo were undoubtedly heroes, and some were 
        undoubtedly utter monsters, but all of them were vastly ambitious! You’re 
        about to be pitched into the middle of this epic struggle between the 
        daimyo. The prize is to become <i>Shogun</i>, the military ruler of Japan, 
        and the controller of the nation’s destiny. The shogun is a more powerful 
        man than the Emperor himself. The reward is tremendous, but the price 
        of failure is death for you and your adopted clan! </font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>&quot;To 
        perceive victory when it is known to all is not really skilful… It does 
        not take much strength to lift a hair, it does not take sharp eyes to 
        see the sun and moon, it does not take sharp ears to hear the thunderclap.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><i>— Sun Tzu, 
        The Art of War</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">History and warfare doesn’t 
        happen by accident. You’ll understand the game much better if you read 
        at least some of this manual. You don’t have to remember everything (there’s 
        no test on this stuff, we promise), but if you do know why daimyo <i>A 
        </i>hates daimyo <i>B </i>but is willing to do a deal with clan <i>C</i> 
        from how real history worked itself out, you’ll have a lot more fun while 
        you’re playing the game. At the very least, it’ll explain who all these 
        people are, and who knows, it might even help you win <b><i>Shogun Total 
        War</i></b>! Think like a daimyo, and you’ll win like a daimyo!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The game has been designed 
        and programmed to think like the daimyo and follow the ideas of Sun Tzu, 
        the Chinese author of <i>The Art of War</i>. If you do the same and follow 
        his principles of warfare, you will triumph and end up as the new Shogun!

      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="5"><b>So who was Sun Tzu?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">All through the <b><i>Shogun 
        Total War </i></b>game and this manual, you’ll find references to — and 
        quotes from — <i>Sun Tzu</i>, and most especially his book, <i>The Art 
        of War</i>. So why was a Chinese writer who’d been dead for centuries 
        so important to the samurai?</font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i><b>&quot;In 
        ancient times skilful warriors first made themselves invincible, and then 
        watched for vulnerability in their opponents.&quot;<br>
        — </b>Sun Tzu, The Art of War</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Sun Tzu was a contemporary 
        of the great philosopher Confucius, and lived around 500 B.C. in the kingdom 
        of Qi, which is roughly the modern Shandong province in Eastern China. 
        During his life, China was being torn apart by a series of wars as lesser 
        states fought for dominance. None of these states recognised the central 
        authority of the Zhou Imperial dynasty any more. As you’ll see later, 
        this is a similar state of affairs to the <i>Sengoku </i>period in Japan.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Sun Tzu was therefore quite 
        familiar with warfare in all its forms. He is supposed to have written 
        his book for Hel&uuml;, the King of Wu during 514-496 B.C. He ruled part 
        of the lower Yangtze Valley and was locked in constant warfare with the 
        rival kingdom of Yue. Other than that, little is known about Sun Tzu’s 
        life. Biographies from as little as 300 years after he was alive don’t 
        include much more definite information than that, other than repeating 
        the tale of how Sun Tzu convinced his king that he knew how to train soldiers. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The story goes that Sun Tzu 
        claimed he could train anyone to obey military orders, and so the King 
        challenged him to turn the court concubines into soldiers. Naturally, 
        the women were far from being any kind of soldiers (much less good ones) 
        and disobeyed all of Sun Tzu’s orders. He explained his instructions carefully 
        and patiently and tried again, with equally disastrous results. Having 
        done all that he could as a commander, he ordered that the leading concubines 
        should be put to death, as once orders have been clearly explained it 
        is the duty of the soldiers to obey! The King wasn’t very happy about 
        the idea his two favourite concubines being executed, and told Sun Tzu 
        that he really did believe he could train troops using his methods. Sun 
        Tzu replied that once a general is directing his troops, he should reject 
        further interference from his sovereign. It’s the ruler’s job to find 
        the best general, and then let him get on with winning a war. The women 
        were put to death!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">All at once the rest of the 
        concubines suddenly discovered that they could, oddly enough, obey any 
        orders to the letter. And although he was rather put out by the death 
        of his favourite courtesans, the King of Wu recognised that Sun Tzu knew 
        what he was talking about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">What is known for certain 
        about Sun Tzu comes from his key work on the theory and practice of warfare, 
        <i>The Art of War</i>. He was obviously a clever man, a clear thinker 
        and someone with practical military experience. Sun Tzu took his accumulated 
        knowledge of how to fight wars and applied careful thought to the problems 
        that he had found. The product of all his thought was the earliest book 
        in the whole world on what might be termed the philosophy and practice 
        of warfare.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">His book, however, is more 
        than just a &quot;how to win&quot; strategy and tactics handbook on Chinese 
        warfare. Although a study of warfare, <i>The Art of War </i>applies to 
        situations on every level from the interpersonal to the international. 
        Its aims are invincibility, victory without battle and unassailable strength 
        through understanding every aspect of conflict. This is a remarkable set 
        of claims for any book. What is even more remarkable is that <i>The Art 
        of War </i>achieves all it sets out to do! It lays out strategy in such 
        a clear and wise fashion that at times it almost seems too straightforward 
        and obvious — almost too <i>simple </i>— to be right. </font></p>
      <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i><b>&quot;Be 
        extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, 
        even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the controllers 
        of your opponent’s fate…&quot;<br>
        </b>— Sun Tzu, The Art of War</i></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i><b>Shogun Total War </b></i>uses 
        the strategies and lessons found in <i>The Art of War </i>as a major part 
        of game play. The game has been programmed to follow Sun Tzu’s precepts 
        because the daimyo and their samurai did so too. Over the centuries, the 
        Japanese have had a long tradition of taking the best and most useful 
        ideas from Chinese culture while managing to keep their independence. 
        <i>The Art of War </i>was one of the many books that arrived from the 
        mainland and was seized upon by the Japanese for its good sense and usefulness. 
        Perhaps this was one of the reasons why the <i>Sengoku </i>period was 
        as violent as it became. Had only one of the great daimyo warlords read 
        and learned from Sun Tzu, the wars would have been over very quickly. 
        However, they had <i>all </i>learned from reading the same master of strategy. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The samurai took Sun Tzu’s 
        book and used its wisdom in their many wars, but they also brought their 
        own unique Japanese perspective to the principles of warfare. In the process 
        they gave warfare a character all their own: </font></p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b><i>&quot;Cutting 
            down the enemy is the Way of strategy, and there is no need for many 
            refinements of it.&quot;</i><br>
            </b><i>— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings, The Wind Book</i></font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Sun Tzu would not necessarily 
        have approved of Musashi’s apparently simplistic attitude at all!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Although times and weaponry 
        have changed over the centuries, the problems confronting military commanders 
        have not, and Sun Tzu remains as relevant today as he was when he first 
        formulated his thoughts, and when he was read assiduously by the samurai. 
        It is still considered essential reading by modern military strategists. 
        Even today, <i>The Art of War </i>remains one of the definitive guides 
        to warfare, and has been read by great commanders the world over. </font></p>

      “Eh?” Dodson said, tilting his head toward the voice. “What means your
      churlish speech? I shall have you know—” “Hunter!” shrieked the whores,
      and they both fled. Deprived of their support, Dodson fell drunkenly down
      into the mud. “Damn you for uncertain quim,” he grunted, and struggled to
      get up. “Look at my uniform now, damn you all.” He was covered in mud and
      manure. He had already gotten to his knees when the words of the women
      suddenly reached his alcohol-fogged brain. “Hunter?” he asked softly. “You
      are Hunter?” Hunter nodded in the shadows. “Then I shall arrest you for
      the scoundrel and pirate that you are,” Dodson said. But before he could
      get back to his feet, Hunter kicked him in the stomach and sent him
      sprawling. “Ow!” Dodson said. “You hurt me, damn you.” They were the last
      words he spoke. Hunter gripped the soldier by the neck and pressed his
      face into the mud and dung of the street, holding the squirming body,
      which struggled with increasing force and, finally, toward the end, with
      violent wrenchings and twistings until at last it did not move. Hunter
      stepped back, gasping for breath with the exertion. He looked around the
      dark, deserted town. A marching patrol of ten militiamen went by; he
      stepped back into the shadows until they had passed. Two whores came by.
      “Are you Hunter?” one asked, with no sign of fear. He nodded. “Bless you,”
      she said. “You come see me, and you’ll have your way without a farthing
      spent.” She laughed. Giggling, the two women disappeared into the night.

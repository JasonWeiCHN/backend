Chapter	1
I	HATE HAVING TO dress like	a	man.
The	cotton	shirt	is	too	loose,	the	breeches	too	big,	the	boots	too uncomfortable.	My	hair	is	bound	on	the	top	of	my	head,	secured	in	a	bun
underneath	a	small	sailor’s	hat.	My	sword	is	strapped	tightly	to	the	left	side	of
my	waist,	a	pistol	undrawn	on	my	right.
The	clothing	is	awkward	as	it	hangs	loose	in	all	the	wrong	places.	And	the
smell!	You’d	think	men	did	nothing	but	roll	around	in	dead	fish	guts	while
smearing	their	own	excrement	on	their	sleeves.	But	perhaps	I	shouldn’t
complain	so.
Such	precautions	are	necessary	when	one’s	being	invaded	by	pirates.
We’re	outnumbered.	Outgunned.	Seven	of	my	men	lie	dead	on	their	backs.
Two	more	jumped	overboard	as	soon	as	they	saw	the	black	flag	of	the
Night
Farer
	on	the	horizon.
Deserters.	They’re	the	most	cowardly	filth.	They	deserve	whatever	fate
comes	to	them.	Whether	they	tire	and	drown	or	get	claimed	by	the	sea	life.
Steel	twangs	through	the	air.	The	ship	rocks	from	the	blasts	of	cannons.
We	cannot	hold	out	much	longer.
“Two	more	down,	Captain,”	Mandsy,	my	temporary	first	mate,	says	from
where	she	peeks	through	the	trapdoor.
“I	should	be	up	there,	shoving	steel	between	ribs,”	I	say,	“not	hiding	like
some	helpless	whelp.”
“A	little	patience,”	she	reminds	me.	“If	we’re	to	survive	this,	you	need	to
stay	put.”
“Survive?”	I	ask,	offended.
“Let	me	rephrase.	If	we’re	to
succeed
,	you	really	shouldn’t	be	seen
performing	impressive	feats	with	the	sword.”
“But	maybe	if	I	just	killed	a	few	of	them…”	I	say	more	to	myself.
“You	know	we	can’t	risk	that,”	she	says.	Then	she	adds	abruptly,	“More
men	have	boarded	the	ship.	I	think	they’re	headed	this	way.”

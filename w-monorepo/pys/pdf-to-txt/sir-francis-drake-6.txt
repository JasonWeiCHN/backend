EXORDIUM
When on the highest ridge of that strange land,
Under the cloudless, blinding tropic blue,
Drake and his band of swarthy seamen stood
With dazed eyes gazing round them, emerald fans
Of palm that fell like fountains over cliffs
Of gorgeous red anana bloom obscured
Their sight on every side.
Illustrious gleams
Of rose and green and gold streamed from the plumes.

That flashed like living rainbows through the
glades.
Piratic glints ofmusketoon andsword,
The scarlet scarves around thetawny throats,
Thebright brass ear-rings inthesun-black ears,
And thecalm faces ofthenegro guides
Opposed their barbarous bravery tothenoon:
Yetadeep silence dreadfully besieged

With mighty prophecies, fraught with adoom
Worthy thegreat Homeric rollofsong,
Yet allunsung andunrecorded quite

Andfrom that lonely Sinai shall return

DRAKE
Mother and love, fairEngland, hearmyprayer,
Asthou didst touch theheart andlight theflame
Ofwonder inthose eyeswhich firstawoke
Tobeauty andthesea's adventurous dream
Three hundred years ago, threehundred years,
And fivelong decades. Intheleafy lanes
OfDevon, where thetallest trees thatbore
The raven's matted nesthadyielded up
Their booty, while theperilous branches swayed
Beneath theboyish privateer, theking
Ofmany young companions—Francis Drake;
Sohearmeandsohelp, formore than his
Myneed Is,eventhanwhen hefirst setsail
Upon thatwildadventure with three ships
And three-score menfrom grey oldPlymouth
Sound,
Notknowing ifhewent tolifeordeath.
Norcaring greatly, sothathewere true
Tohisown sleepless andunfaltering soul,
Which could notchoose buthear theringing call
Across thesplendours oftheSpanish Main
From ever fading, evernewhorizons,
And shores beyond thesunset andthesea.
12

EXORDIUM
Mother and sweetheart, England; from whose
breast,
With alltheworld before them, theywent forth,
Thyseamen, o'erthewide uncharted waste,
Wider than thatUlysses roamed ofold.
Even asthewine-dark Mediterranean
Iswider thansome tide-relinquished pool
Among itsrocks, yetnone thelessexplored
Togreater endsthan allthepride ofGreece
Andpomp ofRome achieved; ifmypoorsong
Now spread toowide asail,forgive thyson
And lover, forthylovewaseverwont
To liftmenupinpride above themselves
Todogreat deeds which ofthemselves alone
They could not;thou hastledtheunfaltering feet
Ofeven thymeanest heroes down todeath.
Lifted poor knights tomany agreat emprise.
Taught them high thoughts, andthough theykept
their souls
Lowly aslittle children, bidden them lift
Eyes unappalled byallthemyriad stars
That wheel around thegreat white throne ofGod.
13

BOOK I
NOW through the great doors of the Council-room.
Magnificently streamed in rich array.
The peers of England, regal of aspect
And grave.
Their silence waited for the Queen:
And even now she came; and through their midst,

Low as they bowed, she passed without a smile
And took her royal seat.
A bodeful hush of huge anticipation gripped all hearts,
Compressed all brows, and loaded the broad noon
With gathering thunder :none knew what the hour
Might yet bring forth; but the dark fire of war
Smouldered In every eye; forevery day
TheCouncil metdebating how tojoin
Honour with peace, andevery daynew tales
OfEnglish wrongs received from theredhands
Ofthat gigantic Empire, Insolent
Spain, spurred fiercer .resentments uplikesteeds
Revolting, onthecurb,foaming forbattle,
14

BOOK I
Inallmen's minds, against whatever odds.
Ononesideofthethrone great Walslngham,
AHonofEngland, couchant, watchful, calm.
Wasnow themaster ofopinion :all
Drew tohim. Even thehunchback Burleigh
smiled
With half-ironic admiration now,
Asinthepresence oftheQueen theymet
Amid thesweeping splendours ofhercourt,
Acynic smile thatseemed tosay,"I,too.
Would fainregain thatforthright heart offire;
Yetstatesmanship Isbutasmoother name
Forthesuperior cunning which ensures
iVictory." And theQueen, too,knowing her
strength
And weakness, though herwoman's heart leaped
out
Tocourage, yetwithwoman's craft preferred
The subtler strength ofBurleigh ;forsheknew
Mary ofScotland waited forthatwar
Tostrike herInthesideforRome; sheknew
Howmany thousands lurked InEngland still
Remembering Rome andbloody Mary's reign.
15

DRAKE
France o'er awallofbleeding Huguenots
Watched foranhour tostrike. Against allthese
What shield could England raise—this little Isle,
Outmatched, outnumbered, perilously near
Utter destruction?
Sothelong debate
Proceeded.
Allatonce therecame acry
Along thestreets andatthepalace gates
And atthegreat doors oftheCouncil-room!
Then through thepikes andhalberds avoice rose
Imperative forentrance, andtheguards
Made way,andastrange whisper surged around,
And through thepeers ofEngland thrilled the
blood
OfAgincourt astothefootofthethrone
Came Leicester, forbehind himashecame
Aseaman stumbled, travel-stained and torn.
Crying forjustice, andgasped outhistale.
"The Spaniards,'' hemoaned, "theInquisition!
They have taken allmycomrades, allourcrew.
And flungthem Intodungeons :there they lie
Waiting forEngland, waiting fortheirQueen!

Queen Elizabeth, 1585
From aPaintiiig byNicholas Hilliard


BOOK I
Willyounotfreethem? Ialoneamleft!
AllLondon Isafirewith it,forthis
Was oneofyour chief citymerchant's ships—
ThePride ofLondon, oneofOsborne's ships I
Butthere Isnone tohelpthem !Iescaped
With shrieks oftorment ringing inthese ears,
The glare oftorture-chambers Inthese eyes
That seenofaces anywhere butblind,
Blind faces, each abruise ofwhite thatsmiles
Inidiot agony, washed with sweat andblood.
The faceofsome strange thing thatoncewasman,
Andnowcanonly turnfrom side toside
Babbling like achild, withmouth agape.
And crying forhelpwhere there isnone tohear
Save those black vizards Inthefurnace-glow,
Moving like devils attheir hellish trade. . .."
Hepaused; hismemory sickened, hisbrain
swooned
Back Intothatwild glare ofobscene pain!
Oncemore tohisearsand nostrils horribly crept
The hissandsmell ofshrivelling human flesh!
Hisdumb stare toldtherest: hishead sankdown;
Hebowed ;hefell ;hestrove Inagony
17

DRAKE
With what allhideous words must leave untold;
While Leicester vouched him, "This man's tale
IStrue I"
Butlikeagathering storm awindy moan
Ofpassion, likeatiger's, slowly crept
From thegrey lipsofWalsingham. "MyQueen,
Willyounotfreethem?''
Then Elizabeth,
Whose name isoneforeverwith thename
OfEngland, rose ;and inherfacethegleam
Ofjustice thatmakes anger terrible
Shone, and shestretched her glittering sceptre
forth
And spoke, with distant empires inhereyes:
"Mylords, this isthelastcrythey shallwring
From English lipsunheeded: wewillhave
Such remedies forthisasalltheworld
Shall tremble at!"
And,onthat night, whileDrake
Close inhisLondon lodging layconcealed
Until heknew ifitwere peace orwar
With Spain (forhehadstruck onthehigh seas
i8

BOOK I
AtSpain ;andwellheknew ifitwerepeace
Hisblood would bemade witness tothatbond,
Andhemust dieapirate's death orfly
Westward oncemore) ,there allalone, hepored
Byastruggling rushlight o'erawell-thumbed chart
Ofmagic Islands Intheenchanted seas.
Dreaming, asboysandpoets onlydream
With those that seeGod's wonders Inthedeep,
Perilous visions ofthose palmy keys.
Cocoa-nut Islands, parrot-haunted woods,
Crisp coral reefsandblue shark-finned lagoons
Fringed with thecreaming foam, mileupon mile
Ofmystery. Dream afterdream went by.
Colouring thebrown airofthatLondon night
Withmany amadmiraculous romance.
There, suddenly, some augury, some flash
Showed himacoming promise, astrange hint,
Which, though heplayed with it,hescarce
believed;
Strange asInsome dark cave the first fierce gleam
Ofpirate gold tosome forlorn maroon
Who tiptoes totheheapandglances round
Askance, anddreads tohearwhat ersthelonged
19

DRAKE
Tohear—some voice tobreak thehush ;butbathes
Both hands with childish laughter inthegold,
And lets ittrickle through hisfevered palms,
And begins counting half ahundred times
And loses count each time forsheer delight
AndWonder InIt:meantime, Ifheknew,
Passing thecave-mouth, faraway, beyond
The stilllagoon, thecoral reef, thefoam
And thewhite fluttering chatter ofthebirds,
Asailthatmight have saved himcomes andgoes
Unseen across theblue Pacific sea.
SoDrake, too,played with fancies; butthat sail
Passed notunseen, forsuddenly therecame
Afirmandheavy footstep tothedoor.
Then aloudknocking; and, atfirst,hethought
"Iamadeadman :there Ispeace with Spain,
And they arecome toleadmetomydoom."
But, ashelooked across oneshoulder, pride
Checking thefuller watch forwhat hefeared.
Thedooropened; andcold asfrom thesea
Thenight rushed In,andthere against thegloom,
Clad, asItseemed, withwindandcloud and rain.
There loomed astately formandhighgrim face
20

BOOK I
Loaded withdeadly thoughts ofIronwar—
Walslngham. Inonehand heheld amap
Marked with redlines ;theotherhand helddown
The richencrusted hiltofhisgreat sword.
ThenDrake rose,andtheother cautiously
Closing thedoordrew near theflickering light
Andspread hismapoutonthetable, saying—
"Mark formehere thepoints whereat theKing
Philip ofSpainmay bestbewounded, mark
The joints ofhisharness;" andDrake looked at
him
Thinking,'*Ifhebetray me, Iamdead."
Butthesoldier met hiseyesand,with alaugh,
Drake, quivering likeabloodhound Intheleash,
Stooped, with hisfinger pointing thusandthus—
"Herewould Iguard, herewould IHeinwait,
Here would Istrike himthrough thebreast and
throat."
And ashespoke hekindled, andbegan
Tosetforth hisgreat dreams, andhighromance
Rose likeamoon reflecting thetruesun
Unseen; and asthe fullround moon Indeed
Rising behind amighty mountain-chain
21

DRAKE
Willshadow forth inoutline grimandblack
Itsvastandragged edges, sothatmoon
Ofhighromance rosegreatly shadowing forth
Thegrandeur ofhisdreams, until theirmight
Dawned uponWalsingham, and he,too,saw
Foramoment ofmuffled moonlight andwildcloud
The vision oftheimperious years tobe!
Butsuddenly Drake paused asonewho strays
Beyond thebounds ofcaution, paused andcursed
Histongue forprating likeamoon-struck boy's.
".Iammad," hecried,"Iammad tobabble so !"
Then Walsingham drew nearhimwith strange
eyes.
Andmuttered slowly, "Write thatmadness down;
Ay,write itdown, thatmadman's plan ofthine;
Sign it,and letmetake ittotheQueen."
Buttheweather-wiser seaman warily
Answered him,"Ifitplease Almighty God
Totakeaway ourQueen Elizabeth,
Seeing that she ismortal asourselves,
England might thenbeleagued with Spain, and I
Should herehave sealedmydoom. Iwillnotput
Mypentopaper."

SirFrancis Walsingham
From anOriginal Painting


BOOK I
So,across thecharts,
With thatdim lightoneachgrim countenance
Theseaman andthecourtier subtly fenced
Withwords andthoughts, butneither would betray
Hiswhole heart totheother. Atthelast
Walsingham gripped thehand ofFrancis Drake
And lefthimwondering.
Onthethird night came
Amessenger from Walsingham, whobade
Drake tothePalace, where, without oneword.
The statesman methim inananteroom
And ledhim,with flushed cheek andbeating heart.
Along amighty gold-gloomed corridor
Into ahigh-arched chamber, hung with tall
Curtains ofgold-fringed silkandtapestries
From Flanders looms, whereon were flowers and
beasts
And forest-work, great knights, withhawk on
hand.
Riding foreverontheirglimmering steeds
Through bowery glades tosome immortal face
Beyond thefairy fringes oftheworld.
Asilver lampswung softly overhead,
23

DRAKE
Fedwithsomeperfumed oilthatshedabroad
Delicious lightandfragrances asrare
Asthose that stirred faint wings ateventide
Through theKing's House InLebanon ofold.
Into aquietness asoffallen bloom
Their feetsank inthatchamber ;and, allround,
Soft hillsofMoorish cushions dimly drowsed
Onglimmering crimson couches. Near thelamp
Anebony chess-board stood Inlaid with squares
Ofrubyandemerald, garnished with cinque-foils
Ofsilver, bears andragged staves :themen,
Likewise ofprecious stones, were allarrayed—
Bishops andknights andelephants andpawns—
'
Asforagame. Sixteen ofthemwere set
Insilver white, theother sixteen gilt.
Now, asDrake gazed upon anarras, nigh
The farther doors, whereon was richly wrought
The picture ofthatgrave andlovely queen
Penelope, with coldhands weaving still
Theunending web, while inanouter court
Thebroad-limbed wooers basking Inthesun
Onpurple fleeces tookfrom white-armed girls,
Up-klrtled totheknee, thecrimson wine;
24

BOOK I
There, ashegazed andthought, "Isthisnotlike
OurQueen Elizabeth, who waits andweaves,
Penelope ofEngland, herdarkweb
Unendingly tillEngland's Empire come?"
There, ashegazed, foramoment, hecouldvow
The pictured arras moved. Wellhad itbeen
Had hedrawn sword andpierced itthrough and
through;
Buthesuspected nothing andsaidnought
ToWalslngham; forthereupon theyheard
Thesound ofalowluteandasweet voice
Carolling likeagold-caged nightingale,
Caught bythefowlers erehefound hismate,
And singing allhisheart outevermore
Totheunknown forest-love hene'er should see.
AndWalslngham smiled sadly tohimself.
Knowing theweary queen hadbidden somemaid
Sing toher,even asDavid sang toSaul;
Since allherheartwasbitter withherlove
OrsoItwasbreathed (and there thechess-board
stood,
Her love's device upon it) ,though she still.
ForEngland's sake,must keep great foreign kings
25

DRAKE
Her suitors, wedding noman tillshedied.
Nordidsheknow how, Inherhappiest hour
Remembered nowmost sorrowfully, themoon,
Vicegerent ofthesky,through summer dews,
Asthatsweet ballad tells Inplaintive rhyme,
Silvering thegrey oldCumnor towers and all
Thehollow haunted oaks thatgrew thereby.
Gleamed onacasement whence thepure white
face
OfAmy Robsart, wifeofLeicester, wife
Unknown oftheQueen's lover, afrailbar
Tothatproud Earl's ambition, quietly gazed
Andheard thenight-owl hoot adark presage
Ofmurder through hertimid, shuddering heart.
Butofthatdeed Elizabeth knew nought;
Nay, white asAmy Robsart Inherdream
Ofloveshelistened tothesobbing lute,
Bitterly happy, proudly desolate;
Soheavy are allearth's crowns andsharp with
thorns I
Buttenderly thathigh-born maiden sang:
26

BOOK I
Song
Now thepurple night ispast,
Now themoon more faintly glows,
Dawn hasthrough thycasement cast
Roses onthybreast, arose;
Now thekisses arealldone,
Now theworld awakes anew.
Now thecharmed hour isgone,
Letnotlove go,too.
When oldwinter, creeping nigh.
Sprinkles raven hairwith white,
Dims thebrightly glancing eye.
Laughs away thedancing light,
Roses mayforget their sun,
Lilies mayforget theirdew.
Beauties perish, onebyone,
Letnotlove go,too.
Palaces andtowers ofpride
Crumble yearbyyearaway;
Creeds likerobes arelaid aside.
Even ourverytombs decay!
27

DRAKE
When theall-conquering mothandrust
Gnaw thegoodly garment through.
When thedust returns todust,
Letnotlove go,too.
Kingdoms meltaway likesnow,
Gods arespent likewasting flames,
Hardly thenewpeoples know
Their divine thrice-worshipped names!
Atthelastgreat hour ofall,
When Thou makest allthings new.
Father, hearThychildren call,
Letnotlove go,too.
Thesong ceased :allwas still ;andnow Itseemed
Power brooded onthesilence, andDrake saw
Awoman come tomeet him,—tallandpale
Andproud sheseemed :behind herheadtwowings
Asofsomemighty phantom butterfly
Glimmered withjewel-sparks Inthegoldgloom.
Her small, pure, grey-eyed faceabove herruff
Was chiselled likeanagate; andheknew
ItwastheQueen. Low bentheo'erherhand;
And"Ah," shesaid,"SirFrancis Walslngham
28

BOOK I
Hath toldmewhat anEnglish heart beats here!
Know youwhat Injuries theKing ofSpain
Hath doneus?" Drake looked upather: she
smiled,
**Wefindyouapt! Willyounotbeourknight?
Forwearehelpless"—witchlngly shesmiled—
"Wearenotripeforwar; ourpolicy
Must stillbetouphold thevelvet cloak
Ofpeace ;but Iwould have Itmask thehand
That holds thedagger !Willyounotunfold

Walslngham, atasignal from theQueen,
Withdrew; andshelooked down atDrake and
smiled;
And Inhisgreat simplicity theman
Spake allhisheart outlikesome youthful knight
Before hisGlorlana: hisheart burned.
Knowing hetalked withEngland, face toface;
Andsuddenly theQueen bentdown tohim,
England bentdown tohim,and hisheart reeled
With thebeauty ofherpresence—forIndeed

Looking into hisfacewith subtle eyes,
"Ihave searched thysoulto-night andknow full

Suchmemories, ontheplunging Golden Hynde,
Under thestars,Drake drew before hisfriend
Doughty; buttouched most briefly onhisgreat
Voyage toDarien, andthefamous Tree,
And those wild exploits down toRioGrande,

DRAKE
Which evennowhadmade hisfierce renown
Terrible toalllonely ships ofSpain.
E^ennow, indeed, thatpoetofPortugal,
Lope deVega, filled with thisnew fear
Began tomeditate hisepicmuse
Till, like acryofpanic from hislips,
Heshrilled thefaintDragontea forth, wherein
Drake isthatDragon oftheApocalypse,
Thedread Antagonist ofGodandMan.
Wellhad Itbeen forDoughty onthatnight
Hadhenotheard what followed; for,indeed.
When twominds clash, notoften does theless
Conquer thegreater; but,without onethought
Ofevil, seeing theynowwere safe atsea,
Drake toldhim, onlysomewhat, yettoomuch.
Ofthat close conference with theQueen.
And, lo!
ThefaceofDoughty blanched with aslowthought
That crept likeacoldworm through allhisbrain,
**Thusmuch Iknew, though secretly, before;
Butherehefreely tellsmeashisfriend;
IfIamfalseandhe iswhat they say,

Hisknowledge ofmyknowledge willmean death."
ButDrake looked round atDoughty with asmile
And said, "Forgive menow :thou artnotused
Tothese coldnights atsea !thou tremblest, friend;
Letusgodown anddrink acupofsack
Toourreturn !"And atthatkindly smile
Doughty shook offhisnightmare mood, and
thought,
"Iamnosea-dog, butamanofbirth!
Theyard-arm isfordogs, notgentlemen!
EvenDrake would notmisuse amanofbirth!"
And inthecabin oftheGolden Hynde
Revolving subtle treacheries hesat.
There with thesugared phrases ofthecourt
And general sentiments which Drake believed
Were revelations oftheman's own mxind,
Bartering beads forgold, hedrew out all
The simple Devon seaman's inmost heart,
And coiled upInthesoulofFrancis Drake.
There Inthesolemn night theyInterchanged
Lies forsweet confidences. From onewall
The picture ofDrake's lovelooked down onhim;
And, likeabashful schoolboy's, thatbronzed face

And quickening breath howhehadseenher first,

AndDoughty comforted hisowndark heart
Thinking, *'Ineed notfear sosoft asoul

Seeing hislove sogripped him,none theless
Could leave her, thus tofollow after dreams;
Forfaith toDoughty wasanunknown word,
And trustfulness theproperty offools.
Atlength they parted, each tohisowncouch.

With oneold-fashioned richly grateful prayer

Soallnight long they sailed; butwhen arift

Andbarred theclosely clouded East withdawn,

And, sullenly rolling outgreat gorgeous folds

And flashed theirweapons out,but alltoolate;
For, eretheir sleeping comrades reached thedeck,
The little watch, outnumbered andoutmatched,
Laybound, and o'er thehatches everywhere
The points ofnaked cutlasses onguard
Gleamed, andwithout astruggle those below
Gave uptheir arms, their poignards jewelled thick
With rubies, andtheir blades ofSpanish steel.
Thenonward o'erthegreat greygleaming sea
They swept with their richbooty, night andday.
Fiveother prizes, oneforevery ship,
OutoftheseasofSpain theysuddenly caught
And carried with them, laughing asthey w^ent—

Solaughed they, plunging through thebay of

With British thunder, though, asonemight dream.

Across thewaves while thatsmall fleetwent by.

Already thosetwotraitors were atwork,

With silver foam across thatancient sea

Toexercise theirweapons andtoseek

ButDoughty with hismen ashore, alone.
Among thesparse wind-bitten groves ofpalm,
Kindled their fears ofalltheymust endure
Onthatimmense adventure. Nay, sometimes
Hehinted ofavoyage farbeyond
Allhistory and fable, farbeyond
Even thatVoidwhence onlytworeturned,—
Columbus, with hismen inmutiny;
Magellan, whocould onlyhound hiscrew
Onward bythreats ofdeath, until theyturned
Inhorror from theThreat that laybefore,
Preferring tobehanged asmutineers
Rather than venture farther. Nor indeed

But,with allhellaround him, intheclutch

Bypoisonous black enchantment. Not Invain
Were Doughty's words onthat volcanic shore
Among thestunted dark acacia trees,
Whose heads, allbentonewaybythetrade-wind,
Pointed Northeast byNorth, Southwest byWest,
Ambiguous sibyls thatwithwizened arms
Mysteriously declared atwofold path.
Homeward oronward. Butaboard theships,
Among thehardier seamen, oldTomMoone,
With oneortwostout comrades, overbore
Alldoubts andquestionings with blither tales
Ofhowthey sailed toDarlen andheard
Nightingales InNovember allnight long
Asdown acoast likeParadise they cruised
Through seasoflasting summer, Eden Isles,
Where birds likerainbows, butterflies likegems,
And flowers likecoloured fires o'er fairy creeks
Floated andflashed beneath theshadowy palms;
While everandanon abarkcanoe
With naked Indian maidens flower-festooned
Putoutfromshadowy coves, laden with fruit
Ambrosial o'erthesilken shimmering sea.
Andonce atroop ofnut-brown maidens came—

SosaidTomMoone, atwinkle Inhiseye—
Swimming tomeetthem through thewarm blue

And wantoned through thewater, like those

Which onegreen April attheMermaid Inn
Heheard KitMarlowe mightily pourtray,
Among hisboon companions, Inasong
OfLove thatswam thesparkling Hellespont
Upheld bynymphs, notlovelier than these,—
Though whiter yetnotlovelier than these;
Forthose likeflowers, butthese likerounded fruit
Rosily ripening through theclear tides tossed
From nut-brown breast andarm allround theship
The thousand-coloured spray. Shapely oflimb
They were; but asthey laid their small brown

Upon theropeswecastthem. Captain Drake
Suddenly thundered atthem andbadethem pack
Foratroop ofnaughty wenches !Atthat tale
Atempest offierce laughter rolled around

Apale-faced prentice, run-away tosea,

BOOK II
Asking whyDrake hadbidden them pack sosoon,
TomMoone turned tohimwith hisdeep-sea
growl,
"Because ourCaptain isnopink-eyed boy
Nor soft-limbed Spaniard, butastaunch-souled
Man,
Full-blooded; nerved likeiron; with agirl
Heloves athome inDevon; and amind

ToknowmyCaptain knows." Andthenhetold
How sometimes o'erthegorgeous forest gloom
Some marble city, rich, mysterious, white.
Anancient treasure-house ofAztec kings.
Orpalace offorgotten Incas gleamed;
And intheirdim richlofty cellars gold.
Beyond allwildest dreams, great bars ofgold.
Like pillars, tossed inmighty chaos, gold
And precious stones, agate andemerald,
Diamond, sapphire, ruby, andsardonyx.
Sosaid he,astheywaited thereturn

On sails orcolls ofrope, while overhead
Some boywould climb therigging andlook out,
Arching hishand tosee ifDoughty came.
Butwhen hecame, hecame with astrange face
Offeigned despair; andwith astammering tongue
Hevowed hecould notfindthose poor supplies
Which Drake himself Inother dayshadfound
Upon that self-same island. But,perchance,
Thiswas abarren year, hesaid. AndDrake
Looked athim, suddenly, andatthemusketeers.
Their eyeswere strained; their faceswore acloud.
That night hesaidnomore; butonthemorn,
Mistrusting nothing, Drake with subtle sense
Ofweather-wisdom, through that little fleet
Distributed hiscrews anew. And all
Theprisoners andtheprizes atthose isles
They leftbehind them, taking what theywould
From outtheir carven cabins,—glimmering silks,
Chiselled Toledo blades, andbroad doubloons.
And, lo!astheyweighed anchor, faraway

And likeatideoftriumph through their veins

Asthere theysawtheavenging ships ofSpain,
Eight mighty galleons, nosing outtheir trail.
AndDrake growled, "Oh,myladsofBideford,

Butwemust notimperil ourgreat quest!

Drake, from theswart commander's trembling

Took thesurrendered sword, andbade hismen
Gather thefallen weapons onanheap,
And placed aguard about them, while themoon

Glanced onthehuddled Spaniards' rich attire,
Aslikeonepicture ofdespair theygrouped

Mysteriously swept thegleaming decks;
Where many abuttofuseless cannon gloomed

Then Drake appointed Doughty, with aguard,
Tosailtheprize ontothenextdim isle
Where theymight leave her,taking aught they

From outhercarven cabins and rich holds.
AndDoughty's heart leaped inhimashethought,

DRAKE
"Ihavemychance atlast"; butDrake, who still
Trusted theman,made surety doubly sure,
And inhiswary weather-wisdom sent—
Even asabreathing type offriendship, sent—
Hisbrother, Thomas Drake, aboard theprize;
Butsethisbrother, hisown fleshandblood,
Beneath theman, asIftosay,*'Igive
Myloyal friend dominion overme."
Socourteously hedealt withhim ;buthe.
Seeing hischance oncemore slipping away,
Raged Inwardly and,from hisown false heart
Imputing hisown evil,hecontrived
Acunning charge thatnight; andwhen theycame
Next day, atnoon, upon thedestined isle,
Hesuddenly spatthesecretvenom forth,
With such fierce wrath inhisdefeated soul
That hehimself almost believed thecharge.
Forwhen Drake stepped ontheSanSalvador
Toorder allthings dulyabout theprize,
What booty theymustkeepandwhat letgo.
Doughty received himwith ablustering voice
Ofredmock-rlghtcous wrath,*'Isthistheway

Then Drake, whose utter silence, with asense

Suddenly thundered—andthetraitor blanched
And quailed before him. "This my flesh and

Nevertheless, theImmediate seamen there
Knowing howgreat aransom theymight ask
Forsomeamong their prisoners, menofwealth

Andonlysaw InDrake's conflicting moods

Half fearful, half defiant, with acrowd
Ofjostling half-excuses onhislips,
Andonedarkswarm ofadders inhisheart.
Fornowwhat light ofchivalry remained
InDoughty's mindwasthickening with aplot,
Subtler anddeadlier than theserpent's first
Attempt onour first sire inEden bower.
Drake, with acountenance open asthesun.
Received him, saying:*'Forgive me,friend, forI
Was hasty with thee. Iwellnigh forgot

And hopes, infriendship, o'erando'eragain.

And with theword hegathered upthechart,
Tookdown hislady's picture with asmile,
Gripped Doughty's hand and lefthim, staring,
sheer
Bewildered with thatmagnanimity
Offaith, throughout allshadows. Insome light
Unseen behind theshadows. Thus didDrake

Fragrant withmemories,—gave It,ashethought.

Tocomprehend thelesser, asthesky

Justifications, thus: "These men oflaw
Aretrained toplead foranyandevery cause,

AndDoughty, though Drake's deed ofkindness
flashed
Amoment's kind contrition through hisheart,
Immediately, with allhislawyer's wit,
True tothecause thathired him,laughed itby.
And straight began toweave thetreacherous web

Against therising insolence ofthemob;
And hinted Drake himself washalf toblame.
Inwords thatseemed tosay,"Iamhisfriend.
OrIshould bidyouthinkhim alltoblame."
Sofierce indeed thestrife became that once.
While Chester, Doughty's catspaw, played with

Thegrim ship-master growled between histeeth,
"Remember, sir,remember, eretoolate,
Magellan's mutinous vice-admiral's end."
AndDoughty heard, andwith aboisterous laugh
Slapped theoldsea-dog onthebackand said,
"Thegallows arefordogs, notgentlemen !"
Meanwhile hisbrother, slyJohn Doughty, sought
Tofantheseamen's fearoftheunknown world
With whispers andconjectures; and, atnight.

Mingling ofcolours onthat coast's deep flank
There crept agarden ofenchantment, height

Wooded aswith Aladdin's trees thatbore
All-coloured clustering gems instead offruit;
Now vaster asitgrewupon their eyes,
And likesomeRoman amphitheatre

With jewels andflowers ablaze onwomen's breasts
Innumerably confounded andconfused;
While lovely faces flushed with lustofblood.

Into themurmur ofthemighty fronds,
Prodigious leaves whose velnlngs bore thefresh

There humming-birds, likeflakes ofpurple fire
Upon some passing seraph's plumage, beat
Andquivered Inblinding blots ofgolden light
Between theembattled cactus andcardoon;
While onehuge whisper ofprimaeval awe

Anopen foetofight !Ay,there shewent,—

And, almost erethelightning, Drake hadgone
Crashing down thefaceoftheprecipice,
Byanarrow water-gully, andthrough thehuge
Forest hetorethestraight andperilous way
Down totheshore; while, three miles tothe
North,
Upon thewetpoop oftheGolden Hynde
Doughty stood smiling. Scarce would hehave
smiled
Knowing thatDrake hadseenhimfrom thattower
Amidst thethunders ;but,Indeed, hethought
Hehadescaped unseen admldst thestorm.
Many adayhehadworked upon thecrew,
Fanning their fearsanddoubts until hewon
Themore part tohis side.Andwhen they
reached
That coast, heshowed themhowDrake meant to

Would havethem suddenly slipbystealth away

If,laying aside thisempty quest, theyjoined
Themerry feasters round those Island fires
Which overmany adark-blue creek illumed
Buccaneer camps inscarlet logwood groves,
Fringing theGulf ofMexico, tilldawn
Summoned theBlack Flags outtosweep thesea.
Butwhen Drake reached theflower-embowered
boat
Andfound themen awaiting hisreturn
There, Inasheltering grove ofbread-fruit trees
Beneath great eaves ofleafage thatobscured
Their sight, butkept thestorm out,asthey tossed
Pieces ofeight orrattled thebone dice.
Hisvoice wentthrough them likeathunderbolt,
Fornone ofthemhadseen theGolden Hynde
Stealfrom thebay ;andnowthebillows burst
Likecannon down thecoast ;andtheyhadthought
Their boat could notbelaunched until thestorm
Abated. Under Drake's compelling eyes,

Nevertheless, theypoled herdown thecreek
Without oneword, waiting their chance.

Together with theirbrandished oarsthey thrust,
Andonthefierce white out-draught ofawave
They shot up,upandover thetoppling crest
Ofthenext,andplunged crashing Intothevale
Behind it:then they settled attheir thwarts,
And thefierce water boiled before their blades
As,withDrake's Ironhandupon thehelm,
They soared andcrashed across therolling seas.
NotfortheSpanish prize didDrake now steer,
Butforthat little shiptheMary gold,

And, inthehands ofFrancis Drake, indeed
Swiftest ofall;anderetheseamen knew

Onehour theyrushed
Northward, withgreen seaswashing o'erthedeck
And buffeted withsplendour ;thentheysaw

Half-mast, afeeble signal ofdistress
Despite allDoughty's curses ;forhercrew
With wild divisions tornamongst themselves
Most gladly nowsurrendered Intheir hearts,
Asclose alongside grandly onward swept

Magnificently drawing thefullwind,

Bare-armed and silent; andthatIronsoul
Alone, upon hersilent quarter-deck.
There theyhauled upIntothewindandlay
Rocking, while Drake, alone, without aguard,
Boarding therunaway, dismissed hisboat
Back totheMarygold, Then hisvoice outrang
Trumpet-like o'erthetrembling mutineers.
And clearly, asiftheywere butbusied still
About theday's routine. They hidtheir shame,

Byflying tofulfil hislightest word;
And eretheyknewwhat power, asofawind

Her sails alldrawing andherbowsafoam;
And, creeping past theMary gold oncemore.
SheledtheirSouthward way! And not tillthen
DidDrake vouchsafe oneword tothewhite face
OfDoughty, ashefurtively slunk nigh
With somenew lieupon hisfear-parched lips
Thirsting forutterance Inhiscrackling laugh
Ofdeprecation; andwithone ruffling puff
Ofpigeon courage inhisblinded soul—
*'Iamnosea-dog—even Francis Drake
Would scarce misuse agentleman. Thank God
Iamagentleman !"And thereDrake turned
Andsummoned fourswart seamen outbyname.
Hiswords went likeacoldwind through their
flesh
Aswith apassionless voice heslowly said,
''Take yethisfellow: bindhimtothemast
Untilwhat time Ishall decide hisfate."
112

BOOK III
AndDoughty gasped asattheworld's blank
end,—
"Nay, Francis," cried he,"wiltthou thusmisuse
Agentleman?" Butastheseamen gripped
Hisarms hestruggled vainly andfuriously
Tothrow them off ;and inhisimpotence
Let slipthewhole ofhistreacherous cause and

Inempty wrath,—"ForeGod," hefoamed and
snarled,

Unhand me,dogs !IhaveLord Burleigh's power
Behind me.There isnothing Ihavedone
Without hiswarrant !Yeshallsmart forthis!
Unhand me, Isay,unhand me!"
And inone flash
Drake sawthetruth, andDoughty sawhiseyes
Lighten upon him; and hisfalse heart quailed
Oncemore ;andhesuddenly suffered himself
Quietly, strangely, tobeledaway
Andbound without amurmur tothemast.
And strangely Drake remembered, asthose words,
*'Yeshall allsmart forthiswhenwereturn,"
113

DRAKE
Yelped athisfaith,howwhile theDover cliffs
Faded from sight heleaned tohisnewfriend
Doughty andsaid:*'Iblame them notwho stay!
Iblame them notatallwho cling tohome,
Formany ofus,indeed, shall notreturn.
Noreverknow thatsweetness anymore."
Andwhen theyhadreached theiranchorage anew,
Drake, having nowresolved tobring hisfleet
Beneath amore compact control, atonce
Took allthemenandthechief gunsandstores
From outtheSpanish prize; andsentTomMoone
Tosetthehulk afire. Also hebade
Unbind thetraitor andordered himaboard
Thepinnace Christopher, John Doughty, too,
Heordered thither, intothegrim charge
OfoldTomMoone, thinking itbesttokeep
Thepoisonous leaven carefully apart
Until theyhadwon wellSouthward, toaplace

And agreat shoutwent up,"Soperish all

Andbadethem totheir ships ;and,wondering,
They lefthim.Astheboats thrust outfrom shore
Brave oldTomMoone looked backwith faithful

Like agreat mastiff tohismaster's face.
He,looming larger from hisloftier ground
Clad with theslowly gathering night ofstars
Andgazing seaward o'er hisquiet dead,
Seemed likesome Titan bronze ingrandeur based
Unshakeable until thecrash ofdoom
Shattered theblack foundations oftheworld.

Outbelched their dusky brood onthedimshore;
Monsters with sooty limbs, red-raddled eyes,
And faces painted yellow, women andmen;
Fierce naked giants howling tothemoon,
And loathlier Gorgons with long, snaky tresses
Pouring vilepurple overpendulous breasts
Like wine-bags. Onthemainland beach they lit
Abrushwood firethatreddened creek andcove
And lapped their swarthy limbs with hideous

Offlame; sonear thatbytheir lightDrake saw
Theblood upon thedeadman's long black hair

Andwhen afairwind rose again, there seemed
Nohope ofpassage bythatfabled way

And, withsomewondrous purpose inhiseyes,
Turned Southward once again, untilhefound
Alonely natural harbour onthecoast
Near SanFrancisco, where the cliffswere white
Like those ofEngland, andthesoft soilteemed
188

BOOK VI
With gold. There they careened theGolden
Hynde—
Her keelbeing thick with barnacles andweeds
And built afortanddockyard torefit
Their littlewandering home, nothalfsolarge
Asmany acoasting barque to-day that scarce
Would cross theChannel, yetshehadswept the

Fornewadventures greater thanthem all.
And asthesound ofchisel andhammer broke
The stillness ofthat shore, shyfigures came,
Keen-faced and grave-eyed Indians, from the
woods
Tobowbefore thestrange white-faced newcomers
Asgods. Whereat thechaplain much aghast
Persuaded them with signs andbroken words
And grunts thatevenDrake wasbutaman,
Whom none thelessthesavages would crown
Withwoven flowers andbarbarous ritual
King ofNewAlbion—sotheseamen called
That land, remembering thewhite cliffs ofhome.
Much theyImplored, withmany asignand cry,

Which bytherescued slaves upon theprize
Were part interpreted, thatDrake would stay
And rulethem ;andthevision ofthegreat
Empire ofEnglishmen arose andflashed
Amoment round them, onthatlonely shore.
Asmall andweather-beaten band they stood,
Bronzed seamen bythelaughing rescued slaves,
Ringed with gigantic loneliness andsaw
AnEmpire thatshould liberate theworld;
Apower before thelightning ofwhose arms
Darkness should dieand alloppression cease;
AFederation ofthestrong andweak.
Whereby theweak were strengthened and the
strong
Made stronger intheincreasing good ofall;
Agathering upofoneanother's loads;
Aturning ofthewasteful rageofwar
Toaccomplish large andfruitful tasks ofpeace.
Even asthestrength ofsome great stream Isturned

Across theuncharted ocean, withnoguide

Faroutofsight ofland they steered, straight out
Across thegreat Pacific, inthose days
When even thecompass proved notrusty guide,

Straight outthey struck Inthatsmall bark, straight
out
Week after week, without oneglimpse ofaught

Straight tothesunset. Laughingly they sailed,
With allthatgorgeous booty Intheir holds,
Asplendour dragging deepthrough seasofdoom,
Aprey tothe firstgreat hurricane thatblew
Except theirGodaverted it.And still
Their skilled musicians cheered thewayalong
Toshores beyond thesunset andthesea.
And oftatnights, theyellow fo'c'sle lanthorn

Asmight amuse her, alsobeofgood cheer
Shebade him,andrestwellcontent hislife
InGloriana's hands were safe :soDrake
Laughingly landed with hiswar-bronzed crew
Amid thewide-eyed throng onPlymouth beach
Andloaded twelve bigpack-horses with pearls
Beyond allprice, diamonds, crosses ofgold.
Rubies thatsmouldered once forAztec kings.
And great dead Incas' gem-encrusted crowns.

Alone, among thefieryAutumn leaves,
Talking ofGodknows what, andsuddenly
Thetemporizing diplomatic voice
Ofcaution hewaswont toexpect fromEngland
And blandly accept ashisimperial due
Changed toaringing keyoffirm resolve,

One night as,with hisgreat vice-admiral,
Frobisher, hisrear-admiral, Francis Knollys,
AndThomas Fenner, hisflag-captain, Drake
Took counsel athistavern, therecame aknock,
Thedoor opened, andcold asfrom thesea
Thegloom rushed in,andthere against thenight.
Clad asitseemed withwindandcloud and rain,
Glittered acourtier, whom byfaceandform
Allknew fortheage's brilliant paladin,
Sidney, theking ofcourtesy, astar
Ofchivalry. Theseamen stared athim.
Each with ahand upon thered-lined chart
Outspread before them. Then allstared at
Drake,
Who crouched likeagreat bloodhound o'er the
table,
And rosewith astrange light burning inhiseyes;
Forheremembered how, three years agone.
That other courtier came, withwords andsmiles
Copied from Sidney's self;and inhisears
Rang once again thesound oftheheadsman's ax
Upon thedesolate Patagonian shore
Beneath Magellan's gallows. With avoice
238

BOOK IX
Soharsh himself scarce knew It,hedesired
This fairnew courtier's errand. With grim eyes
Hescanned thesilken knight from head tofoot,
While Sidney, smiling graciously, besought
Some place intheir adventure. Drake's clenched
fist
Crashed down ontheoldoaktable likearock,
Splintering thewood anddashing hisrough wrist
With blood, ashethundered,"Bytheliving God,
No! We've noroom forcourtiers, now!We
leave
Allthat toSpain."
Whereat, seeing Sidney stood
Amazed, Drake, drawing nearer, said,"You ask
More thanyoudream :Iknow youforaknight
Most perfect andmost gentle—yea, aman
Ready todieonany battle-field
Tosave awounded friend"(even sosaidDrake,
Notknowing hov/indeed thisknight would die,—•

Drake outstretched hisbleeding hand

Andpointed through thedoor towhere thegloom
Glimmered with bursting spray, and thethick
night
Was allonewandering thunder ofhidden seas
Rolling outofEternity: "You'll find

Silently,
Bowing hishead, Sidney withdrew. ButDrake,
Sofiercely theoldgrief rankled inhisheart.
Summoned hisswiftest horseman, bidding him
ride,
Ride likethewind through thenight, straight to
theQueen,
Praying shewould most instantly recall
Her truant courtier. Nay, tomake allsure,
Drake sent agang ofseamen outtocrouch
Ambushed inwoody hollows nigh theroad,

Under thesailing moon, there towaylay
TheQueen's reply, thatshemight neverknow

And swiftly came that truant's stern recall;
ButDrake, inhourly dread ofsomenewchange
InGloriana's mood, slept notbynight
Orday, tilloutofroaring Plymouth Sound

Andtook thewind andshook out allitssails.
Then with theunfettered seahemixed hissoul

Andonward over thegreat greygleaming sea
Swept likeathunder-cloud thepirate fleet
With vengeance inItsheart. Five years agone.
Young Hawkins, intheCapeVerde Islands, met—
AtSantiago—with such treachery
AsDrake burned torequite, andfrom thathour
Was Santiago doomed. Hischance hadcome;
Drake swooped upon it,plundered It,andwas
gone.
Leaving thetreacherous isleadesolate heap
Ofsmoking ashes intheleaden sea,
While onward allthose pirate bowsprits plunged
Into thegolden West, across thebroad
Atlantic once again; "For Iwillshow,'*
Said Drake,^'thatEnglishmen henceforth will

And thegreat glittering crested majestic waves
Jubilantly rushed uptomeet thekeels,

And there wasnought around them butthegrey

Greymounded seas, pursuing andpursued.
That fly,hounded andhounding onforever,

Onward, through storm anddeath, Drake swept;
fornow
Oncemore afellplague gripped thetossing ships,
And notbytwosandthrees asheretofore
Hiscrews were minlshed; butInthree black days
Three hundred seamen Intheir shotted shrouds
Were cast Intothedeep. Onward heswept,
Implacably, having inmind tostrike

Andguarded bygreat guns. Outofthedawn
The pirate shipscame leaping, grimandblack,
And eretheSpaniards were awake, theflag
OfEngland floated from their topmost tower.
246

BOOK IX
But since hehadnottroops enough tohold
Sogreat acity,Drake entrenched hismen
Within thePlaza andheld thebatteries.
Thence hedemanded ransom, andsentout
Aboywith flagoftruce. Theboy's return
Drake waited long. Under asheltering palm
Hestood, watching theenemies' camp; and, lol
Along thehotwhite purple-shadowed road
Tow'rds him, acrawling shape writhed through
thedust
Uptohisfeet, ashape besmeared withblood—
Ashape thatheld thestumps upofitswrists
Andmoaned, aneyeless thing: anaked rag
Offlesh obscenely mangled, asmall face
Hideously puckered, shrivelled likeamonkey's.
With lipsdrawn backward from itsteeth.
"Speak, speak.
InGod's name, speak, what artthou?"whispered
Drake,
And asharp crycame, answering hisdread—
Acryasofasea-bird inthewind
Desolately astray from allearth's shores:
"Captain, Iamthyboy,onlythyboy I
247

DRAKE
See, see,mycaptain :seewhat theyhave done!

"O lad, lad,lad!"moaned Drake, andstooping
strove
Topillow themangled headupon hisarm.
"What have theydone tothee; what have they
done?"
And atthetouch, theboyscreamed onceanddied.
Then likeasavage seawitharms uplift
Toheaven thewrath ofDrake blazed thundering,
"Eternal God, bethisthedoom ofSpain!
Henceforward have nopity. Send thestrength
OfThy great seas Intomysoul, that I
May devastate thisempire—thisredhell
Theymake ofThygood earth."
Hismendrew round,
Staring Inhorror atthesilent shape
That daubed hisfeet. Like acoldwind
Hiswords wentthrough their flesh:
"This isthelad
That bore our flagoftruce. This hath Spain
done.
248

BOOK IX
Look wellupon it;draw thesmoke oftheblood
UpIntoyour nostrils, mycompanions,
Anddown Intoyour souls. Thismakes anend
ForSpain! Bring forth theSpanish prisoners
And letmelookonthem."
Forth theywere brought,
Aswarthy gorgeous band ofsoldiers, priests,
And sailors, hedged between twosturdy files
OfBritish tarswithnaked cutlasses.
Close uptoDrake they halted, under thepalm.
Gay smiling prisoners, forthey thought their
friends
Hadransomed them. Then theylooked upand
met
Aglance thatswept athwart them likeasword.
Making theblood strain backfrom their blanched
faces
Into their quivering hearts, withunknown dread.
Asthataccuser pointed totheshape
Before hisfeet.
"Dogs, willyelaphisblood

DRAKE
Inthat redpuddle of flesh, what? Are ye

Come, come, I'lllook atyou; perchance there's

That's butademl-devil andholds youback."
And with theword Drake stepped among their
ranks
Andreadeach faceamong theswarthy crew—
Thegorgeous soldiers, ringleted sailors, priests
With rosary and cross, aslender page
Inscarlet with acloud ofgolden hair.
Andtworope-girdled friars.
The slimpage
Drake drew before thethrong.*'Youareyoung,"
hesaid,
"Go; take thismessage tothecamp ofSpain;
Tellthem Ihave ahunger Inmysoul

TofacetheSpanish prisoners. With avoice
Cold asthepassionless utterance ofFate
Hisgrimcommand went forth. "Now, provost-

Ashipcame stealing IntoPlymouth Sound
AndDrake washome again, butnottorest;
Forscarce hadhecastanchor eretheroad

Theharsh, rough, straining ropes. There asthey

Answering ascore ofhills, oldBeachy Head
Streamed likeafurnace totherolling clouds.

Andgloomy Cumberland, where, likeagiant.

And thrust Itupagainst thereeling heavens.
Then allnight long. Inland, thewandering winds
Ranwildwithclamour andclash ofstartled bells;
Allnight the cities seethed with torches, flashed
With twenty thousand flames ofburnished steel;
While over thetrample andthunder ofhooves

The lightning ofwild trumpets. Lonely lanes
Ofcountry darkness, litbycottage doors
Entwined with roseandhoneysuckle, roared

Like mountain torrents now—East, West, and

Astothecoasts with pikeandmusket streamed
The trained bands, horse and foot, from every

Andevery hamlet. Alltheshaggy hills
From Milford Haven totheDowns ofKent,
AnduptoHumber, gleamed withmany ahedge
Ofpikes between thebeacon's crimson glares;
While inredLondon forty thousand men,
Incase theinvader should prevail, drew swords
Around theirQueen. Allnight indark St.Paul's,
While round itrolled amultitudinous roar
AsoftheAtlantic onaWestern beach.
And alltheleaning London streets were lit
With fury oftorches, rose thepassionate prayer
OfEngland's peril:
OLordGodofHosts,
LetThine enemies know thatThou hasttaken
England intoThine hands!
Themighty sound
Rolled, billowing round thekneeling aisles, then
died.
Echoing uptheheights. Avoice, far off,
285

DRAKE
Asonthecross ofCalvary, caught itup
Andpoured theprayer o'erthatdeep hush, alone:
Webeseech thee,OGod, togobefore ourarmies,
Blessandprosper them both bylandandsea!
Grant untothemThy victory, OGod,
Asthou usedst todotoThy children when they
please Thee!
Allpower, allstrength, allvictory come from

Then from thelipsofallthose thousands burst
Asound asfrom therentheart ofanocean,
One tumult, onegreat rushing storm ofwings
Cleaving thedarkness round theGates ofHeaven:
Some puttheir trust inchariots andsome inhorses;
Butwewillremember Thyname,OLord, our
God!
So,while atPlymouth Sound herseamen toiled
Allthrough thenight, andscarce ashiphadwon
Seaward, theheart ofEngland cried toGod.
Allnight, while trumpets yelled andblared
without,
And signal cannon shook theblazoned panes,

And thewind slackened andtheglimmering East
Greyed andreddened, yetDrake hadnotregained
Sight oftheships. When thefullglory ofdawn
Dazzled thesea,hefound himself alone,
With onehuge galleon helplessly drifting
Acable's-length away. Around herprow,
Nuestra Senora delRosarioy
Richly emblazoned, goldonred,proclaimed
The flagship ofgreat Valdes, ofthefleet
OfAndalusia, captain-general. She,
Last night, indark collision with thehulks
OfSpain, had lostherforemast. Through the
night
Herguns, longrankondeadly rank,hadkept
Allenemies atbay. Drake summoned her
Instantly tosurrender. Shereturned
Ascornful answer from theglittering poop
Where two-score officers crowned thegolden sea
And stained thedawn with blots ofricher colour
Loftily clustered intheglowing sky,
Doubleted withcramoisy velvet, wreathed
With golden chains, blazing with jewelled swords
314

BOOK XII
And crusted poignards. "What proud hastewas
this?"
They asked, glancing attheirhuge tiersofcannon
Andcrowded decks ofswarthy soldiery;
*'Whatmadman Inyoncockle-shell defied Spain?"
"Tell them itisElDraque," hesaid,"who
lacks
Thetime toparley; therefore itwillbewell
They strike atonce, for Iamingreat haste."
There, atthesound ofthatrenowned name,
Without aworddown came theirblazoned flag I
Like agreat fragment ofthedawn itlay
Crumpled upon their decks. . . .
Intothesoftbloom andItalian blue
Ofsparkling, ever-beautiful Torbay,
Belted aswithwarm Mediterranean crags,
The littleRevenge foamed withhermighty prize,
Aprize indeed—notforthecasks ofgold
Drake split intherichsunlight andpoured out
Like dross amongst hismen, butinherhold
Laymany tonsofpowder, worth their weight
Inrubles now toBritain. Into thehands

DRAKE
Ofswarthy Brixham fishermen hegave
Prisoners andprize, then—loaded stem tostern
With powder and shot—their swiftest trawlers
flew
Like falcons following athunder-cloud
Behind him, aswithcrowded sailherushed
OnEngland's trailoncemore. Like acaged lion
Drake paced hisdeck, praying heyetmight reach
The fight intime; andever thewarm light w^ind
Slackened. Not tillthesunwashalf-way fallen
Oncemore crept outinfront those dusky thrones
Ofthunder, heaving onthesmooth bright sea
From North toSouth withHoward's clustered
fleet
Like tinyclouds, becalmed, nothalfamile
Behind theSpaniards. Forthebreeze had failed
Their bhnd midnight pursuit; andnow attack
Seemed hopeless. Even asDrake drew nigh, the
last
Breath ofthewind sank. Onemore dayhad
flown,
Nought wasaccomplished; andtheArmada lay
Some leagues ofgolden sea-way nearer now
316

BOOK XII
To itsgreat goal. Thesunwentdown :themoon
Rose glittering. Hardly acannon-shot apart
Thetwo fleets laybecalmed upon thesilver
Swell ofthesmooth night-tide. Thehourhad
come
ForSpain tostrike. Theships ofEngland drifted
Helplessly, atthemercy ofthose great hulks
Oared bytheir thousand slaves.
% Onward theycame,
Swinging suddenly intremendous gloom
Over thesilver seas. Buteven asDrake,
With eyesonfireatlastforhislast fight,
Measured thedistance erehegave theword
Togreet itwith hiscannon, suddenly
The shining faceofthedeepbegan toshiver
With dusky patches: thedoomed English sails
Quivered and, filling smart from theNortheast,
The littleRevenge rushed down theirbroken line
Signalling them tofollow, anderetheyknew
What miracle hadsaved them, they allsprang
Their luffandranlarge outtosea. Fornow
TheArmada laytowindward, andtofight
Meant tobegrappled andoverwhelmed; butdark

DRAKE
Within themind ofDrake, afiercer plan
Already hadshaped Itself.
''They fly!They fly!"
Rending theheavens from twice tenthousand
throats
Amighty shout rosefrom theSpanish Fleet.
Over themoonlit waves their galleons came
Towering, crowding, plunging down thewind
Infullchase, while thetempter, Drake, laughed
low
Towatch their solid battle-order break
And straggle. When oncemore thegolden dawn
Dazzled thedeep, thelabouring galleons lay
Scattered bytheir unequal speed. Thewind
Veered asthesunrose. Once again theships
OfEngland laytowindward. Down swooped
Drake
Where likeamountain theSanMarcos heaved
Her giant flanks alone, having outsailed

With broadsides. Two longhours theseaflamed

Then upthewind theships ofEngland sheered
Once more, andonemore daydrew toItsclose.
With little accomplished, half theirpowder spent,
And alltheArmada moving asofold,
From skytoskyoneheaven-wide zone ofstorm

Flewfrom the littleRevenge. With Iron face
Thrust close toHoward's, andoutstretched Iron

Under thestarsDrake pointed down thecoast
Where theredbeacons flared.*'The shoals," he
hissed,
"The shoals fromOwers toSplthead andthenet
Ofchannels yonder^InPortsmouth Roads. At

Swiftly, Inmighty sweeping linesDrake set
Before thecouncil hisfierce battle-plan
Todrive theArmada down upon thebanks
And utterly shatter it—stroke bywell-schemed

Andtouched theirdead coldwarfare Into life,
Where planbefore wasnone, heseemed totower

With their long level lightnings under the cliffs
OfEngland, from thegreen gladgarden of

Andsuddenly thewrench ofthundering cannon
Shook thevast hulks thattowered above them.

The lion's brood was intheImperial nets

With alltheir golden clouds ofsailand flags
Likestreaming cataracts ;alltheir glorious chasms
And glittering steeps, echoing, re-echoing,
Calling, answering, aswith theherald winds

From Skiddaw toHelvellyn. Inthemidst
The great SanMartin surged with heaven-wide
press
Ofproudly billowing sail;andyetoncemore
Slowly, solemnly, likeanother dawn
Uptohermast-head soared inthunderous gold
Thesacred standard oftheir lastcrusade;
While round ahundred prows thatheaved thro'
heaven
Like granite cliffs, their black wetshining flanks,
Andswept likemoving promontories, rolled
Thesplendid long-drawn thunders ofthefoam.
And flashed theuntamed white lightnings ofthe

Back toamorn unhalyarded ofman,
323

DRAKE
Back totheunleashed sunandblazoned clouds
Andazure sky—theunfettered flagofGod.
Like onehuge moving coast-line ontheycame
Crashing, andclosed theships ofEngland round
With one fierce crescent ofthunder andsweeping flame,
One crimson scythe ofDeath, whose long sweep
drowned
The eternal ocean with itsmighty sound.
From heaven toheaven, oneroar, one glitter ofdoom.
While outtothesea-line's blue remotest bound
The ships ofDrake still fled,andtheredfume
Ofbattle thickened andshrouded shoal and seawith
gloom.
The distant sea,theclose white menacing shoals
Areshrouded !And thelion's brood fighton!
Andnow death's verymidnight round them rolls;
Rent istheflagthat late soproudly shone:
The reddecks reel,and their lasthope seems gone!
Round them they stillkeep clear onering ofsea:
Itnarrows; butthelion's brood fight on,
Ungrappled still, still fearless and still free,
While thewhite menacing shoals creep slowly outtolee.

BOOK XII
Now through theredrents ofeach fire-cleft cloud,
High o'ertheBritish blood-greased decks flash out
Thousands ofswarthy faces, crowd oncrowd
Surging, with onetremendous hurricane shout
On, tothegrapple! and still thegrim redoubt
Oftheoaken bulwarks rollsthem back again,
Asbuffeted waves that shatter inthefurious bout
When cannonading cliffs meet the fullmain
And hurl itback insmoke,—soBritain hurls back
Spain;
Hurls herback, only toseeherreturn.
Darkening theheavens with billow onbillow ofsail:
Round thathuge storm thewaves likelavaburn,
The daylight withers, andthesea-winds fail!
Seamen ofEngland, what shallnow avail
Your naked arms? Before those blasts ofdoom
The sun isquenched, thevery sea-waves quail:
High overhead their triumphing thousands loom.
When hark! whatlowdeepguns towindward suddenly

Huddled inhuge dismay tow'rds those white foam-

Plain, Itwasplain atlast,what cunning lured,
What courage heldthem over thejaws o*the pit,
TillDrake could hurlthemdown. The little ships
OfHoward andFrobisher, towed bytheir boats,
Slipped away Inthesmoke, while outatsea
Drake, with agaleofwind behind him, crashed
Volley onvolley intothehelpless rear
OfSpain anddrove Itdown, huddling thewhole
Invincible Fleet together upon theverge
Ofdoom. Oneawful surge ofstormy wrath
Heaved thro' thestruggling citadels ofSpain.
From East toWest their desperate signal flew.
And likeadrove ofbullocks, with thefoam
Flecking their giant sides, they staggered and
swerved,
326

BOOK XII
Careening tow'rds theshallows asthey turned,
Then inonewildstampede ofsheer dismay
Rushed, tacking seaward, while thegrey seaplain
Smoked round them, andthecannonades ofDrake
Raked their wild flight; and their crusading flag,
Tangled inoneblackmaze ofcrashing spars,
Whirled downward likethepride ofLucifer
From heaven tohell.
OuttowVds thecoasts ofFrance
They plunged, narrowly weathering theOwer

Then, once again, theyformed inranks compact,
Roundels impregnable, wrathfully bent atlast
Never toswerve again from theirhuge path
And solidend—tojoinwithParma's host.
And hurl thewhole ofEurope onour isle.
Another daywasgone,much powder spent;
And, while LordHoward exulted andconferred
Knighthoods onhisbrave seamen, Drake alone
Knew that hismighty plan, inspite ofall,
Had failed,—knew that wellnigh hislastgreat

From ships thatcame andwent onwings ofthe

Allround theirmangled bulk, scarce apike's thrust
Away, sweeping their decks from stem tostern
(Between therushandroar ofthegreat green

With crimson death, rending their timbered towns
Andpopulous floating streets Intowild squares

And there agalleon, wrapped Increeping fire,
Suddenly likeavastvolcano split

With allitscurses quivering and alive;
Ahorror ofwildmasts andtangled spars.

Andhuntthemonward aswelacked fornought !"
So,when across theswinging smoking seas,
Grey andsplendid and terrible broke theday
Once more, theflying Invincible fleetbeheld
Upon their weather-beam, anddogging them
Like theirownshadow, thedark ships ofDrake,
Unswerving andimplacable. Ever thewind
And seaincreased; tillnowtheheaving deep
Swelled allround them intosulky hills
And rolling mountains, whose majestic crests.
Like wild white flames farblown andsavagely
flickering,
Swept thro' theclouds; and,ontheir vanishing

With alltheir tinyshrivelling scrolls ofsail,
Through roaring deserts ofembattled death,
Where likeahundred thousand chariots charged
With lightnings andwith thunders, thegreat deep
Hurled themaway totheNorth. From skytosky

DRAKE
Oneblanching bursting storm ofInfinite seas
Followed them, broad white cataracts, hills that

With struggling Titan hands atreeling heavens,
And roared their doom-fraught greetings from

There should theyeast
Offoam receive thepurple ofmany kings,
And thegrim gulfs devour theblood-bought gold
OfAztecs andofIncas, andthereefs,
League after league, bristle withmangled spars,
And allalong their coast themurderous kerns
OfCatholic Ireland strip thegorgeous silks
And chains andjewel-encrusted crucifixes
From thousands dead, and slaughter thousands

With gallow-glass axes asthey blindly crept
Forth from thesurfandjagged rocks toseek
